The more money your movies make in real life, the better your fantasy movie squad performs.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIf you wanted to spend all your money on \\u003Cem\\u003EEntourage\\u003C/em\\u003E, you could do so, but you would only have enough to fill seven of your eight screens. So while you may want the blockbuster movies in your arsenal, it\\u0026#8217;s not always advantageous to go all in on the most expensive movies. Also, who would want to go to a theater where \\u003Cem\\u003EEntourage\\u003C/em\\u003E is playing on every single screen?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThere are four movie \\u0026#8220;seasons\\u0026#8221;—\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://fantasymovieleague.com/howtoplay\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Esummer, fall, awards season, and spring\\u003C/a\\u003E. Players have to consider a variety of factors: How many real-life screens each movie is playing on, what kind of reviews they\\u0026#8217;re getting, how similar movies have fared in the past, and even things like how the weekend they open on could affect how many people go see them. The concept may seem simple, but its execution is anything but.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EInterspersed between Berry\\u0026#8217;s tweets about when is an acceptable time to draft Peyton Manning this year and who will be the lead running back for the Dallas Cowboys are gems like these:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"embed-twitter\\\"\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" width=\\\"500\\\"\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003ERosters lock Noon ET for Memorial Day weekend.

In the case of similarly popular items, a \\u0026#8220;buy now\\u0026#8221; button could be a useful tool. As a follower, I can say, I\\u0026#8217;d likely click it.

I was especially affected because Vice President Biden was among the hundreds of kind well-wishers who sent my husband and me heartfelt personal notes of condolence five years ago after our daughter Hudson died from an aggressive bacterial meningitis infection at the far-too-young age of 17 months.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhile the Vice President's note was certainly unexpected (we later learned that some dear friends reached out to him. They had remembered we met him in 2008 when I was pregnant with Hudson), it was not at all surprising. Having lost his first wife and baby daughter in a terrible car accident almost 40 years before, Biden understands like few others how much comfort the simple act of witnessing another's grief, of refusing to turn away from it, can bring to the grieving.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn his note to us, Biden wrote that there were no words that could ever take away the pain of losing our daughter. So many other notes we received during that terrible time echoed that sentiment -- people said over and over again that if they could do anything to take away even the tiniest bit of our pain, they would do it. They wanted so much to carry even a fraction of it for us so that we wouldn't have to bear it all by ourselves. But they knew that was impossible -- they knew that nothing they could do could ever take our pain away. And they were right. The unfathomable pain of losing our daughter will be with us and part of us for the rest of our lives.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut bearing witness is so important and so fundamental, and it's something that anyone can do for someone who has lost a child.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAfter Hudson died, I remembered something my Lamaze instructor told me when I was preparing for an unmedicated birth. She told me that there was nothing I could do during a drug-free labor that would take away the pain. But there were things I could do to change the sensation of the pain -- breathing techniques, different positions, motion, heat, meditation, music. And when I went into labor with Hudson, I quickly discovered that she was exactly right. During those 27 hours of labor, the pain went from uncomfortable to miserable to excruciating. There were many moments where I thought I would never make it through without an epidural. The pain never went away -- it only got worse. But using all the comfort measures I'd learned beforehand, I was able to change the sensation of the pain, and I was able to bring Hudson into the world exactly like I'd hoped to.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnd when Hudson died 17 months later, that is what so many loved ones, friends and strangers did for me. Unlike the pain of labor, which I survived in part because I knew it would end and that something glorious awaited me on the other side of it, the pain of losing a child doesn't end. But the comfort measures still work. No one can take away the pain, but by bearing witness to my anguish, by offering me love, support, prayers, thoughts, shared tears, messages, phone calls, visits, cards, and memories of Hudson, by simply holding my hand quietly or listening when I cry, so many people have helped change the sensation of the pain.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFive years on from my daughter's death, the people I value the most are those who refuse to turn away from my grief, the ones who continue to bear witness to it. They continue to cry with me and shake their heads in anger and disbelief at the unfairness of it all. Instead of saying, \\\"I can't imagine your pain,\\\" they try to imagine it, and they try to sit with it and with me. They remember Hudson's birthday and the anniversary of the day she died. They send me messages when they see something that reminds them of Hudson, sometimes when they've never even met Hudson. They never fail to offer kind words of support when I post on Facebook about a difficult moment or day. They never expect me to get over it or to move on. They still can't take away the pain, but they can still help change the sensation of the pain.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnd this is why Joe Biden sent us a note five years ago when he heard about Hudson's death, even though he certainly had an infinite number of other things to do. As a bereaved parent and spouse, he understood that he could help change the sensation of the pain simply by bearing witness to it.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnd this is why I'm sending him a note this week. Even though mine will probably be only one in a sea of thousands he will receive, I know unequivocally that every single one will matter. And after losing one child, it is almost impossible for me to imagine the pain of losing another, but for his sake, I am going to try. I am going to bear witness to his grief and refuse to turn away, because I know that even though I can never take away his pain, hopefully I can help change the sensation of the pain.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EThis post originally appeared on the \\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/parenting/wp/2015/06/04/5-years-ago-joe-biden-comforted-her-after-she-lost-her-daughter-now-she-wants-to-return-the-sentiment/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EWashington Post\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003E.\\u003C/em\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T10:13:22-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mandy-hitchcock/5-years-after-my-daughters-death-joe-biden_b_7512404.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mandy-hitchcock/5-years-after-my-daughters-death-joe-biden_b_7512404.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 17:13:22 UTC +00:00], ["title", "5 Years After My Daughter's Death, I'm Remembering Joe Biden's Kindness -- And Returning It"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 17:23:40 UTC +00:00]]

While a lot of personal shame centers around age, income and weight, especially when they're going in the wrong direction, there are other rich sources of shame in life:\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFamily Shame\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSo many people are ashamed of their families that if it weren't for the command performance of holidays many might drift out of touch with them like old roommates. Worse, teenagers who cringed over what their new date would think of Mom and Dad now cringe, 20 years later, over what the date thinks of their kids. They also cringe over what the kids think of the date and the kids, of course, roll their eyes over both the date and the parents.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nCar shame \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhile you're lucky to have a car at all and could be riding mass transit, car shame hits men especially hard. After all, few blame a woman if her car emits white smoke or the engine knocks. They blame her mechanic -- or the man in her life. No wonder men become veritable Martha Stewarts about their cars -- not just the body but its interior. The same man who has never wiped a counter in his own house will vacuum the seats, wash the floor mats, Windex the windows and refresh the air. And don't even think of leaving dirty fingerprints...\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nPet shame\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMany people think of their pets as part of the family but are ashamed of how much they actually spend, like $1,517 on Max's cruciate rupture or $1,244 on Jake's cataract surgery. Nor do they want to admit what they spend per week on a professional dog walker or doggie day care. People also don't like to admit that they shower every day, put on clean clothes, wash and change their sheets regularly but let the dog or cat (or both) sleep in the bed.

Then, on top of a root canal, crown or other uninsured surgery and lab work, they have to be ashamed over the dental denial that made this happen. (And be lectured by the hygienist about gum disease and flossing.) And there's another source of dental shame: So many people have lasered their teeth blinding white, it makes \\\"normal\\\" teeth look grey.

In particular, how do colleges and universities make up the difference between the expenses of athletics and the revenues that athletics programs independently generate?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nRaising this question may elicit surprise from students and parents.  After all, the popular understanding is that college sports generate high revenue and therefore they must be self-supporting.  While the former can be true, the latter is certainly not for the majority of colleges and universities.  The recent report (one of a series over the last several years) reveals that all but a handful (this report about two dozen, but over past several years the number was often smaller) of athletics departments in 300 colleges and universities with major sports programs fail to raise enough revenue to operate their sports programs.  The vast majority requires a subsidy from the institution.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe high athletics costs come from a number of sources, which is beyond the purpose of this writing to explore.  However it is interesting to \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://sports.usatoday.com/ncaa/salaries/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Enote\\u003C/a\\u003E that over 70 coaches are paid salaries are in excess of $1 million annually.  In most states, coaches at state universities are the highest paid public employees in the state.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe next question is how do most athletics departments fill the gap between revenues and expenses?  Students pay the athletics budget directly through special student fees (separate from tuition).  Students also pay indirectly through higher tuition.  Why?  Some form of transfer must occur at most of these institutions from tuition revenues to athletics departments to fund those deficits in the athletics departments.  Those particular tuition revenues cannot then be used to hire teachers or support student services or fix classrooms.  Or other revenues are used that might otherwise support student services and educational expenses, and thus students end up paying indirectly again.  In either case, students support part of the costs of the athletics department budget through their tuition and fees.  The greater the deficits of those athletics departments, the higher the tuition and fees must rise.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMany who give to universities would complain that alumni giving support much of the cost of athletics.  While this is partially true in some institutions, most departments are still in deficit.  It is also true that the needs of the athletics budgets often drive the development offices of major public colleges and universities.  What that means in practice is that athletics often gets the first opportunity to ask donors for money (other causes such as student scholarships then come as a lower priority).  And when a winning team stimulates greater giving to the institution, the bulk of that giving goes to athletics (and yet athletics budget are still largely in deficit!), not to programs that directly support students like academic scholarships.  Therefore, the effect of alumni giving to athletics is not what is commonly perceived.  Athletics still presents a financial burden to the remainder of the institution.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFor many students and alumni, the athletics teams of the college or university are a large part of their continuing interest in the institution.  There is certainly nothing amiss with such enthusiasm.  It is a rare person who does not like to root for their team.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHowever, be an educated shopper.  Be aware that part of the cost of attending college is paying for the teams.  For some institutions the burden is much less than others.  Therefore the pressure of athletics on the tuition you will pay is less at some institutions that at others.  If the teams are important to you and you are willing to pay for them (in addition to paying for your education), then may you get what you pay for! \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T10:11:40-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-philip-l-yeagle/may-you-get-what-you-pay-_b_7503068.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-philip-l-yeagle/may-you-get-what-you-pay-_b_7503068.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 17:11:40 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The High Cost of College Athletics and Your Tuition"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 17:23:40 UTC +00:00]]

Sunscreen does not last all day. After you apply a sunscreen, it's ability to protect you from the sun only lasts for about two hours (1). Yes, that's it. Only two hours. If you apply your sunscreen at 9 a.m., it no longer protects you at 11 a.m. So, to be adequately protected from sunburn, skin cancer, and aging including discolorations, you need to reapply sunscreen every two hours. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n2. You need to apply sunscreen even on days that you are not going to the beach, pool or are sitting in the sun. Many people think that they only \\\"get sun\\\" when they are at the pool or beach. Actually, sunscreen must be applied everyday that you leave your home during the day to protect your skin. We have learned that you get significant sun expose while doing simple everyday things like driving your car or walking down the street.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n3. Most Americans simply don't use sunscreen. A recent study found that only 14 percent of men and 30 percent of women regularly applied sunscreen when out in the sun for an hour (2). \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n4. Spray sunscreen is potentially flammable. When applying sunscreen spray, stay away from flames (for instance, your barbecue grill), because it has the potential to be flammable. There was a report of a man who caught fire after applying spray-on sunscreen before grilling (3). Another hazard with spray sunscreen is that you can skip areas due to uneven spray application so make sure that you have not missed any areas. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n5. If your mineral makeup or powder contains an SPF, you still need to apply a separate SPF.  Mineral makeup and powders do not provide an even film over the face, so you protection from the sun is uneven. For adequate protection, use a sunscreen or a facial moisturizer that contains sunscreen (4).\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EReferences:\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n1. \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/05/sunscreen-mistakestips_n_3377817.html\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Ehttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/05/sunscreen-mistakestips_n_3377817.html\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n2.

It is eight o'clock in the evening, and while late night work is a familiar scenario for most scientists, the presence of Buchanan's two young sons playing a game in the common area outside the lab is not. \\\"My wife let me work on this project only if I promised to continue sharing the child care responsibilities,\\\" he explains. A computer programmer by day, Buchanan pursues a self-funded genome editing project in his spare time, enabled by the shared facilities and low price point of \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://genspace.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EGenspace\\u003C/a\\u003E, a community biolab in Brooklyn.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBuchanan is not alone. The economic downturn has resulted in a surfeit of unemployed and underemployed scientific experts itching to get back into the lab and flex their underused intellectual muscles. Some were forced into jobs outside their main field by economic necessity, and others just made what they now consider to be a bad decision to work in a field unrelated to their original passion. As Genspace's director, I am seeing more and more of these part-time entrepreneurs showing up at our doorstep. And unlike many of the original inhabitants of these spaces, who had little or no previous biology experience, these biohackers have the background to ensure that their projects are focused and their research goals realistic.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAside from the obvious benefit of retaining intellectual property rights and the lure of cheap lab space, there are many other advantages to innovating within a community lab. It's almost impossible not to be aware of public opinion if you are in such an informal, inclusive setting. Rubbing shoulders with a motley crew helps innovators keep sight of what the consumer market might be for their potential biotech products. Bioluminescent plants were actualized in university labs a decade ago, but it took members of the San Francisco Bay Area hackerspace Biocurious to found a company and demonstrate the consumer's fascination with glowing organisms via a Kickstarter campaign that asked for $62,000 and ended up raising half a million. (Techonomy recently \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://techonomy.com/2015/03/a-glowing-plant-the-first-fruit-of-digitized-genetic-engineering/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Epublished a piece with Antony Evans\\u003C/a\\u003E, the CEO of the resulting company, Glowing Plant.)\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nLikewise, the vegan's hunger for cheese is being addressed by \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://realvegancheese.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EReal Vegan Cheese\\u003C/a\\u003E, a joint venture by Biocurious and Counterculture Labs that started as an International Genetically Engineered Machine competition entry and has attracted lots of interest. \\\"We've had people offer us money already,\\\" says Patrik D'Haeseleer, one of the team working on moving the milk casein genes into yeast.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMonsanto leaders admit now that when they began introducing GMO foods, they assumed that the only relevant consumer was the farmer. In contrast, the Real Vegan Cheese project was only launched after extensive polling of vegans to see if they would consider milk proteins made in yeast acceptable.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nInnovators operating within community labs also benefit from the oft-mentioned diversity and culture of sharing that pervades these spaces. Instead of experiencing the top-down mentoring of an accelerator program, members freely share their expertise with other members in an unstructured, casual way. After Genspace member Larry Melnick shared lunch with patent lawyer Andy Berks, he got more than he bargained for. \\\"I thought I would give him a crash course in molecular biology,\\\" said Melnick, \\\"but instead I ended up learning a ton of stuff about intellectual property rights, all very relevant to my project.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOn a given afternoon at Genspace you might find Will Canine (who is the co-founder of OpenTrons, a startup that has gone through accelerators and raised venture capital) chatting with another member whose open-source bioreactor might soon follow the same trajectory. Later that evening, OpenTrons gets business advice from another entrepreneur in our community who recently sold his larger, non-science-related business to Amazon. The overall effect is a bolstering of all innovation within the space in a distributed and multicentric manner as people are helped and in turn share their experience with others who are not as far along in their plans. This is very different from the paternalistic one-way flow of knowledge in a typical accelerator program.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nLast month a major biotech trade publication's good-news headline was \\\"\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.genengnews.com/keywordsandtools/print/3/37227/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EPace of Layoffs Slows Down\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\\" The system's loss is our gain. Unfettered by institutions, the new biohackers have discovered that community labs have more benefits than just cheap lab space. The first crop of startups out of the citizen science movement was nurtured in part by founders with very little experience in biotech innovation, and it is unclear whether all of them will survive the hype phase and actually turn out products. This next wave of startups promises to be more formidable as the more seasoned players step up to the plate. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T10:06:59-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/techonomy/the-new-biohackers-how-an_b_7512240.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/techonomy/the-new-biohackers-how-an_b_7512240.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 17:06:59 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The New Biohackers: How (and Where) They Work"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 17:23:40 UTC +00:00]]

To what degree should these companies be responsible if experiments kill patients, and should that obligation differ if the patients are American or Ugandan? Companies often require that study patients in the U.S. have sufficient health insurance before enrolling, excluding patients without adequate coverage. But is that unfair?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nInformed consent forms are now often 40 pages, crammed with scientific and legalistic jargon that most patients don't understand. Comprehension problems burgeon in the developing world, where many subjects are only semi-literate. Researchers routinely enroll into studies patients who don't fully understand the informed consent. Drug companies now pay thousands of dollars to doctors to switch patients from generic medications to more expensive experimental drugs that may work less well. Facebook has conducted studies on users, successfully altering their mood, without their knowledge.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSome people see Nazi crimes as morally evil, but view these experiments as merely business practices that may be a bit unfair. The two sets of activities clearly differ in magnitude, but both pose certain underlying moral concerns: how much obligation do we have to each other? Is it ever ok to harm another person, and if so, when?   \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThese are fundamentally moral questions, long central to religion, but increasingly posed in hospitals and clinics. In our modern secularized world, how are they now addressed, and how should they be? \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn 1974, a journalist revealed the moral lapses of the Tuskegee syphilis study in which researchers, funded by the U.S. government, studied the course of this disease in African-American men in the South.  When penicillin became available as a definitive treatment, the researchers decided not to mention or offer it to the men, since doing so would destroy the experiment.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/after.htm\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EIn response, Congress passed the National Research Act,\\u003C/a\\u003E which led to the creation of\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E research ethics committees, known as institutional review boards, or IRBs\\u003C/a\\u003E, to oversee the ethics of research. Today, the U.S. has around 5,000 of these committees.  Every hospital and college has one, or uses one elsewhere. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYet increasingly, these boards have themselves become criticized. They frequently operate wholly behind closed doors; and have approved research that violated ethical guidelines, and delayed or blocked other, important studies. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSince the Act passed, science has changed. Many studies now involve 40 different hospitals, but must then be approved by 40 committees, which often disagree, requiring changes in varying parts of the study, such that the data between these sites cannot be compared or combined.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThese committees tend to assume that they each are always right -- that they each represent their local community values, and thus cannot be challenged, even if they disagree with each other.  If an IRB adamantly rejects a study, the researcher is stuck.  No external appeals process exists.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nTo address these problems, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/anprmchangetable.html\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EPresident Obama proposed changes\\u003C/a\\u003E, including using a single centralized IRB for multi-site studies; and in February 2015 sent a revised set of recommendations to the Office of Management and Budget.  But the content of these revisions remains secret.  In December 2014, the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-026.html\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ENIH also recommended such centralization\\u003C/a\\u003E.  A period of public comment ended earlier this year; and the proposals are now being revised.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut while these recommendations can help certain studies, they are insufficient, and miss larger points: that deep moral quandaries, ambiguities and tensions are often involved. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIRBs wrestle with dilemmas that often lack a single right answer. Committees struggle their best, but often don't have any training in moral reasoning. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMedical centers want certitude, one and only 'right' answer, and technological fixes. Yet \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Ethics-Police-Struggle-Human-Research/dp/0199364605/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Erecent research I conducted\\u003C/a\\u003E found that these committees disagree due not to local community values, but  because of other, idiosyncratic reasons.  IRBs even in the same institution and community often disagree with each other. Rather, committees vary due to the personalities of whoever happens to be a member, and whether the institution has recently faced a scandal or lawsuit.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhen confronting moral dilemmas, many people look for answers to the Old or New Testament, the Quran, or sayings of the Buddha. But these modern scientific problems did not exist when these religious documents were created.  We may be able to draw some broad principles, but are left to wrestle with the novel complexities and challenges of each case.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nUnfortunately, we often lack critical tools and skills to address these complex moral decisions.  Most universities do not require any classes in moral values or decision making.  We follow our implicit gut feelings, but need to do more.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nTo improve the process of ethical oversight of research, we need to change our attitudes, and recognize far more fully that complicated moral issues, strains and vagaries are involved.  We need to require ethical training for IRBs, and a broad open discussion about the underlying social and moral tensions involved.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSuch improvements can aid not only research subjects, but our health, science and moral lives - as individuals and as a country and world as a whole. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T10:04:46-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-klitzman-md/morality-religion-and-experimenting-on-you_b_7495898.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-klitzman-md/morality-religion-and-experimenting-on-you_b_7495898.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 17:04:46 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Morality, Religion and Experimenting on You"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 17:23:40 UTC +00:00]]

As much as the transformation of American attitudes toward gay marriage has swept across the country like a prairie fire over the past decade, the emergence of transsexual and transgender identities in mainstream culture in recent years has been no less breathtaking. This isn't merely a matter of idle curiosity, of course. Lives are at stake, particularly given the extraordinarily high reported suicide and attempted suicide rates among transgender individuals, and the countless lives and families submerged and broken by fear of living out what has, until recently, been a profoundly stigmatized way of being. Of course, many, many people still find uncomfortable or unacceptable the reality of gender identity as anything apart from the physiological sex characteristics with which one is born. But a sphere of acceptability has been carved out that has changed dramatically the possibilities for trans people to live self-determined lives. The volume and thrust of the attention Caitlyn Jenner's story has received is the latest and most ringing example of this larger cultural shift. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nTo step back for a moment, the coverage of Caitlyn Jenner this week has me thinking about an early-in-life experience I had with what was - back in the 1970s, to the extent that it was discussed at all - typically referred to as trans-sexualism. I was born cross-eyed (Strabismus is the preferred medical term). It compromised my vision and necessitated surgery when I was five years old, in early 1971. That surgery was performed by a noted opthalmologist, Dr. Richard Raskin. I remember Dr. Raskin well - he was a kind, caring and excellent doctor. He also happened to be physically striking - tall and handsome, facts that always made an impression on me when I saw him. I had numerous follow-up appointments with him in the years after the surgery, until I was about ten. Raskin was, at this time, a top male amateur tennis player, not that I had any awareness of that during the time I was a patient in his care.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nRichard Raskin became famous not for his work as an eye doctor or an amateur male tennis player. He became famous as a woman - Renee Richards, one of the very first prominent transsexual individuals in the United States. Raskin became Renee in 1975 and eventually decided to play professionally as a woman, which she did with a good deal of success between 1977 and 1981 (by which time she was 47). Richards faced a storm of controversy, befuddlement and derision for who she was (some of which was chronicled in a television movie, based on Richards' memoir, starring Vanessa Redgrave, who played both Richard and Renee). Some time in the summer of 1977 or 1978, when I was 11 or 12, my mom awkwardly tried to tell me what had happened to Dr. Raskin. She imagined that the news would be upsetting to me so rather than explain it to me herself, she directed me to the pile of Sports Illustrateds in my room to read an article about a female tennis player named Renee Richards. At first, I was indeed stunned. I didn't really know how to make sense of what I was reading, as the vivid images of the person who became Renee Richards in my mind were still those of Dr. Raskin, so that every time I thought about Renee Richards I had a jarring split screen in my head.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIt's been nearly forty years since I last saw the doctor who took such good care of me. When I see pictures of Dr. Renee Richards today, I confess I still have something of that that split screen in my head, though the line down the middle is more blurred. But in addition to coming to terms with the passage of time etched in her face, photos of Richards today prompt fondness for the person before me. It mattered profoundly to Renee Richards to live as her true self. All that mattered to me was the warm, comforting manner and the great skill that my doctor possessed. In that respect, as in so many others, the man then and the woman now are one and the same person.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYou can follow my musings on ESPN and other \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://theespnwatch.wordpress.com/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Esports media here\\u003C/a\\u003E. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T11:46:54-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-weiler/thinking-of-caitlyn-jenne_b_7513190.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-weiler/thinking-of-caitlyn-jenne_b_7513190.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 18:46:54 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Thinking of Caitlyn Jenner, Remembering Renee Richards"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 18:55:50 UTC +00:00]]

Since Asia accounts for a large portion of that workforce and a rising share of global economic activity, its importance for the professional network is bound to grow.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAt \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://techonomy.com/conf/te14/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ETechonomy 2014\\u003C/a\\u003E, Weiner \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://techonomy.com/conf/te14/conversations-with/conversation-jeff-weiner/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eenvisioned LinkedIn as a platform\\u003C/a\\u003E that connects all the world's workers, companies, and educational institutions. This is not an impossible dream. LinkedIn already has more than \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://press.linkedin.com/about-linkedin\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003E364 million registered members globally\\u003C/a\\u003E. Many use the service actively to establish their professional identify, find opportunities, and engage with professional content.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYet with 68 million members in Asia, LinkedIn's presence there is relatively small, especially considering the region's vast population and rising centrality for the global economy. While the professional network includes more than half the world's knowledge workers, less than a third of those in Asia are members.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nLinkedIn's user base is growing quickly in some parts of Asia. It has over 13 million members in Southeast Asia, more than \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.tigermine.com/2013/10/31/linkedin-expansion-southeast-asia-2011-2013/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Edouble what it had there in mid-2013\\u003C/a\\u003E. It also includes more than 30 million in India, up from 20 million just two years ago.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nChina has been harder. Back in 2013, the professional network had \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://techonomy.com/2013/07/asia-is-getting-linkedin-but-not-everywhere/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eonly 3 million Chinese users\\u003C/a\\u003E, less than Australia at that time. It had not yet opened a China office or released a Chinese version of the network, despite having already localized to Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn 2014, LinkedIn started \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/technology/to-reach-china-linkedin-plays-by-local-rules.html?_r=0\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Emaking aggressive moves into China\\u003C/a\\u003E. It launched in Chinese and inked deals with two prominent Chinese venture firms, both with connections crucial for navigating China's tricky regulatory environment. Unlike other American tech giants like Google and Twitter, LinkedIn also decided to accede to government censorship requirements.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOn account of these measures, LinkedIn's user base in China grew to roughly 8 million in 2015. But in a speech at a tech conference hosted by Morgan Stanley in 2014, Weiner estimated China still \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm15S1QmOTw\\\"\\u003Ehas roughly 140 million professionals and students\\u003C/a\\u003E. And as 250 million rural Chinese migrate to cities in the next decade, the urban workforce may continue to grow.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe good news for LinkedIn is that China's emerging middle class is \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-10-30/how-linkedin-cracked-the-chinese-market\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehungry to connect with global professionals, companies and educational institutions\\u003C/a\\u003E. In Japan, where self-promotion and job-hopping are culturally discouraged, LinkedIn may face greater friction. Today, it only has a little over a million Japanese users, despite early efforts to localize to the country.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nCuriously, many Japanese professionals are more likely to use Facebook for professional networking than LinkedIn. In a \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-japanese-dont-use-linkedin-james-riney?trk=prof-post\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EMarch 2015 LinkedIn post\\u003C/a\\u003E, an American entrepreneur in Japan wrote that Facebook gives Japanese professionals a greater opportunity to build personal connections as they network, which is important in their business culture. It also allows them to share their achievements discreetly and indirectly, such as through photos of work events.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe same holds true in South Korea. \\\"Facebook is still Korea's default business networking tool,\\\" says Nathan Millard, CEO of \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.g3partners.asia/\\\"\\u003EG3 Partners\\u003C/a\\u003E, a tech-focused PR firm based in Seoul. \\\"Koreans are gradually getting onto LinkedIn, but it's happening slowly.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn Southeast Asia, LinkedIn is faring well in most markets, but has yet to crack the million-user mark in Vietnam. Having used LinkedIn's premium products for several sales and recruiting projects in the country, I've noticed decent uptake among Vietnamese professionals working at foreign companies, and those with foreign education. But very few professionals with primarily local experience, on the other hard, are on LinkedIn.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSimilar circumstances prevail in many of Asia's emerging markets, where LinkedIn's membership skews heavily towards internationally-minded professionals. In such markets, LinkedIn is still valuable for high-level prospecting, executive recruitment, and advertising to professional audiences. For hiring non-executive staff in Vietnam, however, I'm much more likely to turn to local jobs sites like \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.vietnamworks.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EVietnamworks\\u003C/a\\u003E and \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://itviec.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EITviec\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nCould LinkedIn eventually emerge as a tool for the entire global workforce, from factory workers and taxi drivers to lawyers and entrepreneurs? Could it open doors for students at vocational schools in emerging markets, just as it does for graduates from four-year universities in the developed world? Weiner has a bracing vision, but given that Asia's population exceeds 4.4 billion, let's just say that the opportunities there for LinkedIn remain vast.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EWill Greene runs \\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.tigermine.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003ETigerMine Ventures\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003E, an advisory firm that helps companies and organizations grow in Southeast Asia.

You followed a procedure of combining compounds, call them A and B,  to create a new compound, call it C. The experiment was performed literally millions of times every year by other students in chemistry classes. While it is true that the specific molecules of compounds A and B are randomly selected, the outcome once they are close together is regulated by basic laws of chemistry and physics. You get compound C every time. So randomness does play a role in producing compound C, but it is a minor effect compared to the chemical inevitability that is controlled by the underlying laws of chemistry and physics. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe can take this example from your direct experience of the laws of chemistry and easily scale them up to more complex reactions. In those cases, you get chemical pathways that produce intermediate compounds, whose abundances are also strictly controlled by chemical laws (actually quantum mechanics) and by the temperature, pressure, energy and concentration of the chemicals along the way.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBecause of the regularity that is imposed by the laws of physics on the way that atoms function and combine in three dimensions, an incredible amount of chemistry can now be performed on a computer instead of at the laboratory bench! \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIf chemistry were as random as Creationists insist on claiming, you would not have the experiments you performed in high school 40 years ago look anything like the ones that your grandchildren are performing today. So even though you may like the 'randomness' argument that Creationists keep making, your own experience proves that this is not how chemistry works at all.  From this point on, it is only a matter of degree not kind.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBefore his \\\"famous\\\" quote, Hoyle has this to say.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003EThe creationist is a sham religious person who, curiously, has no true sense of religion.

But to say that the vast collection of statements, often conflicting, found in the Old Testament is the direct word of God and supports Creationism is not the majority view of most priests and theologians. Even the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.iflscience.com/brain/pope-endorses-scientific-account-origins\\\"\\u003E Catholic Pope Francis \\u003C/a\\u003Ehas issued a formal statement in 2014 that evolution and Big Bang cosmology are entirely consistent with canonical interpretation. \\\"When we read the creation story in Genesis we run the risk of imagining that God was a magician, with a magic wand which is able to do everything,\\\" Pope Francis said. \\\"But it is not so. He created beings and let them develop according to internal laws which He gave everyone, so they would develop, so they would reach maturity.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nA similar position was voiced by Pope Pius XII in 1950. These are the direct marching orders for 1.5 billion Catholics around the world, but they will most certainly not sway protestant literalists, of which Creationists are a member, and whose members are just as likely to view the Pope as the anti-Christ, which was the basis for the Protestant Reformation in the first place!\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOne case in point is found in \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+4\\\"\\u003EGenesis 4\\u003C/a\\u003E, after Cain slew Abel. He was given a Mark so that all of the people he encountered after leaving Eden would recognize him. But as many people have pointed out, at the time of his eviction, there were only three people left: Adam, Eve and Cain. Who were those other people? In the land of Nod, Cain also took a wife, and their son Lamech also took two wives. So where did these women come from? If you are a Creationist you will flummox some kind of explanation and deny that 'Godless evolution' plays any role, and that these other women were later children of Adam and Eve, for example. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAll the rest of us look at Genesis as a story not intended to be factual. Even those of us who see evolution as a factual statement of the organic world see a very simple interpretation of this biblical story. Those other people could have been Neanderthals who co-evolved with us but later became extinct about 30,000 years ago, but not before our direct ancestors Homo Sapiens interbred with Neanderthals. That's why you and I have four percent Neanderthal genome in every cell. Is this the legendary Mark of Cain? \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIf you insist on aligning scientific knowledge with religious canon, it is far simpler and satisfying to see religion in a world of scientific explanation, than to repudiate most of our scientific knowledge in favor of poorly-translated and multi-authored statements written 3000 years ago.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn the end, Creationism is here to stay. Not because of some compelling logical argument, but because there is no social penalty for being a Creationist in a largely conservative American culture. There are, however, enormous social consequences for not believing in Creationism if you live in an insular fundamentalist community, which nearly all Creationists do. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T11:45:39-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-sten-odenwald/the-argument-against-the-scientific-origin_b_7509914.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-sten-odenwald/the-argument-against-the-scientific-origin_b_7509914.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 18:45:39 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The Argument Against the 'Scientific' Origin of Life"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 18:55:50 UTC +00:00]]

We live in a very exiting time, in a truly global world which will be even further globalized in the near future. It is on us to build a strong global network that allows all of our countries and citizens around the world to have access to knowledge and enable them to trade with their foreign counterparts. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nLet's start with the US. Generally speaking the US is doing great economically, but the current strong US dollar is showing mixed results for US businesses, with some benefiting from working with manufacturers and suppliers with lower currency rates and others facing the disadvantage of receiving revenue in weaker currencies.  European and Japanese companies like Canon, L'Oreal and Siemens are among the manufacturers and retailers who stand to benefit from a stronger US currency. On the other hand, exporters and many large U.S. multinational companies are preparing for a decrease in their earnings. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIt seems that the US dollar will continue to rise in comparison to other currencies. At the same time we also experience improvement in the Eurozone economy as well as growth in India and China. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFactors contributing to the recent economic pickup for the Eurozone economy, where a true rise in GDP was and is still somewhat of a concern, include cheaper oil, looser credit and a weakening euro. The Eurozone is expected to grow by 1.2 percent in 2015, an increase from the 0.9 percent growth seen in 2014. As the second-largest economy in the world, the Eurozone's expected growth should, also in turn, increase the global growth rate. This is great news! Germany reported GDP growth as well as other smaller countries, while France and Italy remained stagnant. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOn the other side of the world, everyone should keep a close eye on the rapid growth rates of both India and China. The race between India and China became closer during the past fourth quarter when comparing their GDP growth. Recent reports have shown that India is growing faster than China; however, India has also changed how it calculates GDP, which figured India's fourth quarter growth at 7.5 percent and therefore was faster than China's at 7.3 percent. Falling oil prices, a progressive government and other cheaper commodities have helped India's economic growth, but in absolute numbers speaking China's economy is still and will stay much larger than that of India.  I feel that China is the new Germany of Asia with a disciplined workforce, the largest middle class in the world. Count them in to be contributing even larger shares to the world economy. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn addition to the close race in growth rate between India and China, there are also new developments in business relations between the US and India. Despite concerns arising from the recent nuclear pact between the US and India, the Indian market still remains to be a huge gain for the industry.

We know clinical lab results are tightly regulated, so we take their accuracy as a given. Assuming the same thing about lab results from a genetic test, however, could be a mistake.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSome medical genetic tests look only for the presence or absence of well-understood gene variants, so lab reports come back simply \\\"positive\\\" or \\\"negative.\\\" For more complicated tests, which often scan whole genes or try to find rare or novel variants, the reports are more complex too. Results are returned classifying each genetic variant based on how likely it is to cause disease (in clinical parlance, ranging from \\\"pathogenic\\\" and \\\"likely pathogenic\\\" to \\\"likely benign\\\" and \\\"benign\\\").\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nLike a cholesterol report, genetic results look official and authoritative. The problem is that for such complex genetic tests, the report delivers an opinion rather than a fact. To be sure, that opinion is a highly educated, highly researched, carefully considered one; but it's an opinion nonetheless. Since more and more of us are receiving such results, it's worth taking a moment to understand how they are determined.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFor your average medical test, a tube of blood or urine is shipped off to a clinical lab, which runs it through a series of instruments. At the end of a fairly automated pipeline, the instruments generate a result: the numbers representing your cholesterol or white blood cell count or creatinine. Those numbers go straight to the lab report. There is little human participation in the process, and not coincidentally, little room for error.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nA complex genetic test--that is, one looking for more than just the presence or absence of a single genetic target--begins much the same way, using a pipeline of impressive technologies thoroughly vetted for accuracy and reproducibility. At the end of this pipeline, however, the results that are generated are not ready to be put on a lab report. There may be hundreds or thousands of genetic variants identified, and no physician or genetic counselor has the expertise to make sense of them all.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThis is where the genetic testing process veers off onto a course of its own. At this point, the list of genetic variants will be filtered to remove anything known to be unrelated to the current test, and the rest delivered to highly-trained clinical geneticists tasked with interpreting results. They will look up each variant on Google, concentrating their search to peer-reviewed scientific publications that have mentioned the variant. They'll read various publications, using their experience to figure out whether what's reported in the paper might indicate if this particular variant is likely to cause a disease. They also search various genetic databases and use modeling tools to hypothesize how each variant might affect its owner. Researching any individual variant can take hours.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAfter all this information is gathered, the geneticist weighs the evidence and categorizes the reported variants on that pathogenic-benign spectrum. Most labs require at least two people to look at the same evidence and agree on the conclusion, but the outcome remains a data interpretation. Given the human element, it's no surprise that studies of this still-nascent field show that labs interpret variants differently. Lab A might tell you your variant is probably benign, while Lab B might say it's possibly pathogenic. That's OK as long as people know that there's benefit to getting a second opinion--but too many patients assume that a lab report for genetic results is as incontrovertible as a cholesterol report. Ongoing studies of inter-lab variability are expected to report more fully on this situation.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnother thing to keep in mind with any genetic variant interpretation is that each report represents a snapshot in time. A scientific paper published after you get your result, for example of some variant that was classified as likely benign, might provide data that would have, in retrospect, made the clinical geneticist consider your same variant likely to cause disease. You've already got the result, so unless you're tracking scientific literature on your own, you may not find out that the variant is now classified differently, which could possibly suggest different medical treatment recommendations than you received.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nDecades from now, when knowledge in this field is more comprehensive, it may be possible to remove the interpretation step completely, since we should be able by then to simply match known variants to a vast database of functional changes. But today, it's important to remember that results of genetic tests are based on medical opinion and the current understanding of genetics--two things that will change significantly over time. If you know your genetic test was a complex one, and if you're planning major surgery or another big change because of the results, getting a second opinion may be well worth your time.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EOriginal article published at \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://techonomy.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ETechonomy.com\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/em\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T11:42:33-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/techonomy/why-genetic-tests-may-cal_b_7513174.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/techonomy/why-genetic-tests-may-cal_b_7513174.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 18:42:33 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Why Genetic Tests May Call For a Second Opinion"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 18:55:51 UTC +00:00]]

Seems to me that allegory was created to separate readers into two groups: people that understand allegory, and people who don't.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI'm in the latter group. I'm a pretty experienced reader, and I feel fairly confident that I can absorb, with some regularity, an author's message, slant, intent and, most important, emotion. But when I read something that suggests a hidden meaning, I start to feel the sweat of nervousness accumulating on my neck. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nRecently, I started reading a book that, according to reviewers and other sadists, was sure to win a prestigious award. I should have known better. Awards, some say, are given to very good books that few people actually want to read. My own overweight bookshelves are a pretty good testament to that adage. I have hard cover editions of all the major tomes, their perfect, unbroken bindings taunt vertically at me from a sloping shelf. Did I buy them because I thought they'd make me seem erudite? More likely, they were on sale at Costco. My copy of one hefty prize-winner is currently in use as a footstool under my desk. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe definition of allegory is a short story, poem or picture that can be interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning, typically a moral or political one. The book I'm reading is clearly trying to reveal something, but what is it? My husband commented that he'd never seen me read more slowly. \\\"That's because I'm missing something,\\\" I explained. \\\"This story is trying to say something about something.  But I can't figure out what it is. I feel like a half-wit!\\\" I took off my reading glasses and massaged my eyes. \\\"It could be about communism or love or risk. It's sort of like the Odyssey.\\\"  I took off my reading glasses and massaged my burning eyes. \\\"It's a quest, with choices that impact the entire world. And there are serfs, and...\\\" I stopped. \\\"Ugh. I'll have to find my book on mythology. \\\" I put the book on the nightstand, giving up for the night. \\\"I know I'm supposed to glean something,\\\" I said to my husband. \\\"But I just don't know what to glean.\\\" I'd hoped for a response but he was was already asleep.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThere are many literary devises to enthrall the reader. Take metaphor, for example. Metaphor is easy. Spoiled rotten. Pleased as punch. Metaphor is a frequent participant in ordinary speech, and no one walks away with creases in the forehead trying to figure out what a punch has to be pleased about. We get it. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHyperbole looks harder than it is. Hyperbole is simple exaggeration. I have a million things to do today. That's hyperbole (unless, of course, you work at the speed of an android like Data of Star Trek the Next Generation).  No one is confounded by hyperbole, as far as I know.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nParody is one of my favs. Parody is a distorted imitation of a famous person with the intent to ridicule.  SNL parodies people in the news every week, exaggerating slips, missteps, blunders or generalized idiocy. Parody is fun. At least the people employing parody appear to be having fun.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAllegory is not fun. Allegory requires a herculean effort, a nose-to-the-gindstone attitude, and David v. Goliath determination.

While we have abundant cause to question our native wisdom, we have equal cause for faith in human ingenuity. We wanted our footprints on the moon, and since we agreed where to find it -- were able to get there from here. Were we to agree on where to find healthy, sustainable eating -- we could, I believe, get there, too. My worry is that unless we agree, we never will.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe prize awaiting us there is years added to lives, life added to years, and the residual splendors of this planet not already squandered as the birthright of our children, and their children.

Were we to rally around the fundamentals of healthy eating, and rail collectively against the promulgation of confusion and the propagation of diversions, we could induce a rush of wind beneath the wings of EAT, and related laudable movements such as \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://foodtank.com/\\\"\\u003EFood Tank\\u003C/a\\u003E, and \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.wcs-ahead.org/\\\"\\u003EOne Health\\u003C/a\\u003E, and \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.myplatemyplanet.org/\\\"\\u003EMyPlateMyPlanet\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis would not be so were optimal diets for human health at odds with sustainability, conservation, climate stabilization or biodiversity. Were that the case, we might have a difficult choice. The evidence, however, suggests just the opposite; what's best for us is generally also best for the planet and the creatures with whom we share it, although the sheer numbers of us -now, and projected- pose a challenge. At some point, there may simply be so many human mouths to feed, that we devour our planetary resources no matter how carefully we manage them. I hope we muster the resolve and allocate resources to avoid this doom, although our \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-katz-md/nine-or-12-billion-things_b_693757.html\\\"\\u003Eseeming disinclination even to talk about it\\u003C/a\\u003E bodes ill.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFor now, though, we can feed everyone and preserve the planet if we commit to the confluence of the two. My one other task at EAT was directly related to this convergence: participation in a working group addressing dietary guidelines, and their relationship to sustainability. We reviewed and discussed emerging guidelines from around the world, with clear indications that the inclusion of sustainability is both the new norm, and prominently so.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe also discussed the fact that in the U.S., we are currently waiting to see if the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015-scientific-report/\\\"\\u003Erecommendation of scientists\\u003C/a\\u003E to include sustainability in our dietary guidelines will weather the storm of corporate protest, and lobbying. We noted with concern that our Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack, chastised the scientists comprising the \\u003Ci\\u003EDietary Guidelines Advisory Committee\\u003C/i\\u003E for, in essence, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.agri-pulse.com/Vilsack-assures-on-dietary-guidelines-02252015.asp\\\"\\u003Ecoloring outside the lines\\u003C/a\\u003E. Their mission, according to the Secretary, whose work I have admired before, was to address nutrition (i.e., human health), not planetary stewardship.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut this view is objectively wrong, and for reasons that are as self-evident as the distinction between the Titanic, and the lifeboats in which survivors huddled. On a titanic cruise ship, there is a seeming, endless bounty- with food and water selected and consumed accordingly. Transition to crowded lifeboats, however, and that same population is indisputably obligated to look at water and food supplies quite differently. Consider how absurd it would be for, say, a preventive medicine specialist in such a lifeboat to insist that he get the optimal nutrition to which he is accustomed, and rationing be damned!\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOur current situation is just so. With more than seven billion of us established here, with California drying up, with climate changing and traditional crops failing, with extinctions accelerating and with environmental stresses globally near the breaking point, earth is no longer an unsinkable, titanic cruise ship. To treat it as such is benighted folly. Earth is now our lifeboat. In it, we can ration our resources rationally, or we can eat our children's food. The notion that guidelines for healthy eating can be dismissive of whether or not the food in question exists, or will for much longer, is like eating on a lifeboat as if still on the mother ship. It approximates slow suicide, and worse.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThat, then, is my view.

Now shifts in how Washington works require that companies adopt new, technology-driven government affairs strategies. Here are some of the signs of the transformation underway in Washington: a decrease in Congressional action; increased complexity in regulations; the growing relevance of social media; and the proliferation of information services and access to new information.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFor businesses of all sizes in all industries, there has never been a more critical moment to recognize these changes and act on them. A recent Bloomberg Government (BGOV) analysis of how companies perceive government activity's impact on their business revealed that no external force outranks government activity in its material impact on shareholder returns. Further, BGOV found that the interconnection between business and government is growing.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnd yet despite these powerful realities, businesses are generally unchanged in how they engage with Washington.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe changes taking place in Washington create both risk and opportunity. Executives must adapt. To develop a competitive advantage that translates directly into shareholder value, forward-thinking Washington offices will utilize quantitative, systematic frameworks to inform engagement decisions, adopt new digital tools that provide deeper insights into the nuances of government action, and objectively measure engagement outcomes.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EA Decade of Change\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFor companies engaged in Washington, it's no secret that the dynamics of advocacy have changed.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nCongressional action has decreased, calling into question the efficacy of traditional legislative-only strategies. Numerous political scientists have tracked the growing polarization between Democrats and Republicans on the ideological spectrum--along with the shrinking number of moderates. Since 1970, the two major parties have increasingly voted along party lines. In the 108\\u003Csup\\u003Eth\\u003C/sup\\u003E Congress, 498 new laws were enacted. By the 113\\u003Csup\\u003Eth\\u003C/sup\\u003E Congress, that number had declined by more than 40 percent to 297 enacted laws.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHowever, this void of legislative opportunities has been filled with increasing amounts of regulatory action--with review times for \\\"economically significant\\\" rules growing by over 100 percent from 2008-2014. For the 2009-2014 time period, the average number of \\\"economically significant\\\" final rules published annually grew by 30 percent to 55 rules per year compared to an average of 42 in the 2003-2008 time period.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMoreover, social media has undermined conventional voices of power. Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social platforms are as important if not more important than traditional media outlets. Hillary Clinton's Twitter account has approximately 1 million more followers than the total number of viewers of NBC's \\\"Meet the Press.\\\" With these new media technologies challenging Washington's model for media engagement, organizations can now more easily activate employees, vendors, and customers around an issue and accurately track their impact in real time.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOpen data has also created new ways for companies to transform risk into opportunity. For example, federal lobbying data has become increasingly more accessible, enabling government affairs shops to have a better understanding of where their competitors are allocating resources. With better insight into the competition's engagement, companies can more effectively employ their resources by either reducing redundancies or surfacing new opportunities. Companies that leverage open data will have better insight into advocacy opportunities.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EHow to Win in Washington \\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nTransformations in the way Washington does business--combined with an increase in available data and technology--require a data-driven, systematic approach to influencing policy outcomes. A successful government relations strategy can no longer only include facilitating meetings for out-of-town executives while monitoring and communicating activity.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nExecutives quantify performance in all other areas of their business.So what should CEOs be doing in Washington to drive bottom-line performance?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe first critical element is to combine their current Washington resources with a data-driven approach to advocacy. Implementation of sophisticated workflow tools developed by innovative technology companies (full disclosure: BGOV is one of those companies) can bring transparency to the competitive landscape, eliminate cognitive biases, and enable new ways of affecting desired outcomes. These new tools allow organizations to connect the dots with real time alerts on legislative and regulatory action, and enable the tagging and search of contracting opportunities, ensuring advocates don't miss an opportunity. BGOV, for example, objectively evaluates the performance of thousands of lobbying firms every quarter to help companies find their optimal external advocating partners.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSecondly, the implementation of a systemic, repeatable engagement process is a necessity. BGOV has developed the following high-level framework to help CEOs and government affairs professionals gauge Washington activities and quantify maximum value:\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Col\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\t\\u003Cli\\u003EIdentify a universe of all direct and indirect government related issues posing opportunities or threats to the company's business.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\t\\u003Cli\\u003EFor each issue, derive an expected value based on probability of occurrence and present value of incremental cash flows or cost savings.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\t\\u003Cli\\u003EDefine a fixed set of issues to engage on, taking into consideration the expected value, thresholds for materiality, and available resources.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\t\\u003Cli\\u003EUnderstand and draw from a portfolio of levers, including internal and external options, to allocate resources accordingly.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\t\\u003Cli\\u003EConduct an ex-post evaluation of engagement activities to quantify results, make necessary adjustments, and justify resource requests.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003C/ol\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhat happens in Washington today is more important than ever for the business community. And while executives can allow continuation of traditional engagement practices, those who recognize existing shifts and implement a systematic engagement process that leverages data and transparency tools will drive material business value.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EDon Baptiste is co-founder and head of Bloomberg Government, an online subscription service that provides news, data, references, analysis, and workflow tools.

I simply think his art is good and that it is poised well to increase in value - especially given the very reasonable prices it often sells for at auction. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-31-1433096535-7277855-prurience.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-31-1433096535-7277855-prurience.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-31-1433096535-7277855-prurience-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"448\\\" height=\\\"570\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nJohn's art is original. I'd challenge anyone to argue this point. And, that pure originality is a huge factor in my determining this work as a good investment. Although I do recognize that not everyone buys art to make money, and nor should you. One should buy art because it speaks to them, because it inspires and invokes - or provokes, and because you can and want to live with the piece. It also doesn't hurt, however, to buy art that is original, from someone with a long history of production, and from someone who will sell work that doesn't break your bank. Again, John Swinton comes to mind. John has been at work seriously for over three decades and it shows. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-31-1433099366-8151718-settledintoabook.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-31-1433099366-8151718-settledintoabook.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-31-1433099366-8151718-settledintoabook-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"416\\\" height=\\\"570\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHaving had a relationship with John's art for some time, I decided to write to him and ask a few questions about what inspires this work and what he's all about.

This vacant trope has survived 116 years that include heavier-than-air flight, relativity theory, antibiotics, semiconductors, and the Internet.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nA century later, not only do we believe that the policymakers must do a better job, but we believe they can.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBreakthroughs in medicine, data science, online education, renewable energy, and satellite navigation have changed the world. From smartphones to PET scans, from pest-resistant seeds to asteroid landings, the list of extraordinary, ingenious, life-changing achievements is almost endless. Many of these advancements came from the vision and early investment of places such as NASA, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut from a public policy perspective, the pace of improvement is harrowing. Consider, for example, that it took almost all of recorded history--more than 5,000 years--to fulfill the dream of controlled flight. That's more than 150 generations. In about two generations--or 23,961 days to be exact--we went from the sand dunes of Kitty Hawk to the moon rocks in Tranquility Base. Imagine trying to create an investment thesis for aviation in 1903. Imagine trying to regulate it. But this is tantamount to what we ask public officials to do every day, from Internet telephony to stem-cell research, from GPS to Ebola, from nuclear power to artificial intelligence.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe need to find a better way to match our scientific ingenuity with our public interest. Your authors have had the privilege of working in senior positions in the federal government. We have seen our share of both visionary success, as well as obstructive and grossly ineffective policies. We want to make simple suggestions that we believe would help government avoid the pitfalls of inadvertent bureaucratic congestion and more rapidly improve safety, increase access, and regulate more transparently.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAn example can help illustrate the challenge. From 2009-2013, the VA had a backlog of applications for former military members with service-connected disabilities. These ranged from knee problems to sleep apnea. At the peak, there were almost 1 million unprocessed claims, with more than two-thirds pending for over 125 days. Dedicated adjudicators schlepped around paper files, looked up compensation in encyclopedic manuals, and kept stacks of folders on and in filing cabinets that were so heavy the buildings had to be structurally reinforced. Amazingly, in the three decades since, most of the private sector moved to automate claims processing systems, the VA claims system had changed little.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe VA took on the challenge to design, implement, and deploy an enterprise-class automation system. Today, the number of pending claims is down by more than half. The catch--it took five years to achieve it.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHow do we reconcile that we are capable of intergalactic space flight and incapable of processing simple forms to serve veterans better?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe believe there is a real opportunity for government to rethink and restructure itself to better leverage technological advances ranging from automated self-service access for beneficiaries to military preparedness and capability. In a world that is rapidly changing--commercially, technologically, environmentally, and militarily--this is not just a philosophical or wonkish public policy challenge. It is a basic matter of global competitiveness. Otherwise we will find ourselves outmaneuvered in the classroom, the clinic, the marketplace and the battlefield.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nCurrently, government officials live in a viscous environment that limits their ability to buy, never mind use, even ordinary services that we take for granted in the private sector. Imagine an insurance company that takes more than four months to process a claim, or a modern workplace that uses 15-year-old computer network technology, or the community that deliberately slows Internet access or limits how much you can store in the archive. It's hard to visualize those things in business or civil society because they literally do not exist. Nobody would live, work, or do business there. Yet today, that is the place where government is all too often cornered.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAn almost petrified aversion to risk slows government decisions, even when they are time sensitive. As maddening as this can be, it is an understandable reaction to an environment where mistakes can be disastrous and hard to undo; moreover, decisions need to include many voices and perspectives.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nConsequently, governments around the world need to find mechanisms that simultaneously enable greater opportunity for their social entrepreneurs as well as better protection for citizens. The new structures will need to use data more wisely, make decisions more quickly, and regulate more fairly. They will also need to provide data to collaboratively achieve performance-measured outcomes, and better engage communities and civil society's participation in the process.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nGoverning in the old ways no longer works. Historically, we've seen arduous and rigid top-down processes, based on incomplete and static data, analyzed endlessly with obsolete tools. Then, only the loudest (or best funded) stakeholders are selectively engaged before new legislation or rules are written. If we stay on that track our infrastructure will crumble, our students will underachieve, our businesses will fail in the global market, and we'll make poor national security decisions.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nGovernment can create more transparent and iterative mechanisms in order to achieve its dynamically changing goals. We do not need a constitutional amendment, just a better way of doing things that closes the capabilities gap between private industry, non-profits, and the public sector.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe propose an alternative framework for how government can redefine and restructure its role in leading and facilitating this process, especially as it relates to technology and policy:\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EGovernment can be a canonical source of information.\\u003C/strong\\u003E Government already collects a significant amount of transaction and compliance data. These should be made available in audited and machine-readable form, with exceptions for data that intrude on personal privacy or are truly defense sensitive. Additionally, government could collect significantly better outcomes data. To achieve this, it needs to invest in simple technology platforms that help normalize incoming and performance data and then make it easily available to partner agencies and civic stakeholders. This data can also connect with citizens on the platforms where they chose to engage. One example of this is the data set produced by the \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.mcc.gov/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EMillennium Challenge Corporation\\u003C/a\\u003E, which was the most transparent development agency in the world in 2013, and the third-most in 2014, as ranked by \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EPublish What You Fund\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EGovernment can learn to iterate on solutions.\\u003C/strong\\u003E Rather than making big policy in small rooms, government can test ideas, fund limited prototypes and scale up based on data and experience. A great example is the VA Blue Button, which enables veterans to get a complete copy of their personal health records. Today, more than 2 million people who receive federal healthcare benefits or services use this service. Data platforms, including non-personally-identifiable financial performance and health data, should be made (and updated) \\\"open by default\\\" allowing entrepreneurs and other stakeholders use of the data to create businesses, such as those based on weather satellites or GPS. There are already experiments underway where this is happening.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EGovernment can fund outcomes, not processes.\\u003C/strong\\u003E Today, government largely funds \\\"services by the yard,\\\" either the number of people served or number of things done. Government should fund outcomes. Examples include programs that actually reduce homelessness or measurably improve clinical care services. This requires funding groups that achieve quantifiable results and giving them the capital to grow, rather than just pure compliance. A tremendous example of this is the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Fact-sheets/2015-Fact-sheets-items/2015-01-26-3.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Erecent announcement\\u003C/a\\u003E from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that 50 percent of its reimbursements will be \\\"fee-for-value,\\\" instead of \\\"fee-for-service,\\\" by 2018. As a result, the emphasis is placed on the quality of care, not simply the cost of a given service. Additionally, this example of government as leader and facilitator has emboldened the private sector to also move in this direction. As a result, we'll see improved healthcare for the nation.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EGovernment can create regulation with iteration.\\u003C/strong\\u003E There is a real opportunity to rethink how current business practices affect citizens. For instance, how to find the right balance between the safety of medicines and the speed we get them to market. Or, enabling digital access for small and rural businesses, while enticing large companies to invest in communications infrastructure. This requires renegotiating whose interests needs to be protected, and why. Currently, we are piling on to a decrepit foundation of old regulations, written in the time of monopolies, limited choice, and expensive services. We must be willing to sunset, remove or replace old policies, regulations, and programs that no longer meet our needs. Instead we are endlessly adding to them, creating a bureaucratic Rube Goldberg-like structure that stagnates, frustrates, and obstructs progress. We need to continuously examine whose interests need to be protected, and why, in a way that allows the regulations to adapt and learn on a continuous basis.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EGovernment can engage citizens where they live and work.\\u003C/strong\\u003E Technology offers government an opportunity to gather more diverse input, more inclusively. This requires government to actively and deliberately reach out to communities to ensure broad participation. At the same time, citizens need better insight into their rights (and responsibilities) so government can be more representative and therefore more effective. In addition to social media channels like Twitter and Facebook--which governments including some of our adversaries around the world are learning to use very effectively--there are interesting new models for collaborative governance. One example is participatory budgeting, which empowers citizens to decide how to allocate local funds in their communities. Another example is better (and targeted) recruitment and training for the people we need to make the new policies, systems, and technology work.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe have the tools and expertise to solve these problems. We have solutions that can save lives and inspire them. We have citizens who are keen to participate. So why not create a more effective, collaborative, and responsive government?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe next generation of technology tools is already here. So are the engaged young people who want to use them. Now we need to connect them to each other, and to our government, to create high-flying solutions that will change how we live, learn, heal, play, protect, work, commute, and communicate.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe believe that these principles form a framework that is safe, fair, and fulfilling. Using them would help close the technology gap between the private sector and the public sector, and help government achieve its goals ... and ours.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003ESonal Shah is executive director of the Beeck Center for Social Innovation and Impact at Georgetown University, Stephen Ondra is senior vice president and chief medical officer at Health Care Services Corporation, and Peter Levin is chief executive officer of Amida Technology Solutions.

The U.S. government has a duty to protect human rights, including against businesses, and where there are allegations of criminal activity by a company, it is incumbent on our officials to investigate and prosecute those crimes. Unfortunately, there are significant legal, political and practical challenges to doing so that must be overcome.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWithout naming Nike, the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/27/fifa-scandal-nike-brazil_n_7453032.html\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Eindictment\\u003C/a\\u003E of 14 FIFA officials for corruption and other charges alleges that a major U.S. sportswear company paid bribes to secure a sponsorship deal for the Brazilian national team. And Nike owes some of its success to World Cup sponsorship -- Nike's profits have grown as it has worked to edge past competitors as the world's premier soccer brand. These increases in earnings and soccer attire sales can be linked to the company's heavy investment in the World Cup. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAlthough the sponsorship deal struck years ago may be of little interest to soccer fans, focusing on illegal acts by corporations is critical. Prosecuting and convicting corporations and corporate officials deters future bad acts, serves as an example for other companies, and in some instances, can help secure redress for victims of those crimes. All of this is especially necessary when human rights are implicated by criminal acts.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe human cost of corruption -- and the illegal corporate acts that enable them -- has come to light in the aftermath of awarding Qatar the 2022 World Cup bid as there have been suggestions that Qatar secured the World Cup through bribery. \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2014/country-chapters/qatar\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EHuman rights organizations\\u003C/a\\u003E have uncovered flagrant exploitation of laborers and abuse that amounts to modern-day slavery in Qatar's preparations for the tournament.

He carried with him a portfolio of his recent work, including a number of smaller paintings that he had put tremendous effort into. When he showed the gallery director his work it seemed to go well: there were murmurs of approval and meaningful glances. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThen, the gallery director asked a much-anticipated question: \\\"How much do you want for these?\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe artist responded without hesitation. \\\"I need to get about $1,000 each for them, so I expect you could sell them for about twice that amount.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe conversation came to an immediate halt. \\\"\\u003Cem\\u003EHmmm...\\u003C/em\\u003E\\\" said the gallery director; \\\"Come back in a a few years when you are getting some higher prices for your work.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYes: that happened. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHere is what this anecdote says to me. The problem wasn't the art, as the gallery director clearly liked it, but rather that the artist didn't price his art high enough. It seems counter-intuitive, doesn't it? Yet he made the right call, as he knew his clientele well and understood that low prices would put them off. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nRich people need to feel rich when the collect and they need more breathtaking \\\"price points\\\" to feel their affluence when they choose art. Add to that, art dealers have to pay the rent, and they like high priced art too. One of the reasons that more and more art dealers are interested in re-selling blue chip works is that a single transaction might bring them ten times the profit of selling work by an emerging and lesser-known artist. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nArt is a luxury, not a necessity, and when it hangs on your wall part of what it is meant to broadcast is that you can afford fine, expensive things. The comedian Steven Martin apparently understood this and parodied it very nicely when he put price stickers on all the art that hung on the walls of his first apartment. If you are a serious collector, you don't want to be seen as what one former curator for a local billionaire once characterized in an interview as \\\"Another fucking Jaguar driving dentist from Encino.\\\" \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWelcome to the wacky world of art pricing where the word \\\"bargain\\\" can curse a sale and an artist's reputation. Whether you are a collector or a collector/speculator you are going to respond to the enticing idea that an artist's prices are moving up, not down. You don't want to stand in your living room explaining that \\\"I love my Rolf Smeldley painting: I got it just as his reputation and prices were tanking.\\\" Upward marching prices are erotic while declining ones are just sad. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIf Picasso paintings from the 1950s are now going for $179 million a pop, that makes you want one even more, right? When it comes to luxury items conspicuous consumption rules and bargains are for mall shoppers. As a collector, you want to generate envy among your peers, and buying relatively inexpensive works is unlikely to do that as only connoisseurs will appreciate your taste. Money, on the other hand, is a universal language that \\u003Cem\\u003Eeveryone\\u003C/em\\u003E understands. What many \\u003Cem\\u003Edon't\\u003C/em\\u003E understand is that art and money have some strange chemistry together.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThink about this: if you don't have taste, but you do have money, art can hide your deficiencies. Expensive art flatters those who have the \\\"wisdom\\\" to shell out for it. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe all learned the laws of supply and demand in Econ 101 -- the law of demand states that the quantity of a good demanded falls as the price rises -- but the art world defies this maxim. Andy Warhol, Thomas Kinkade and other sharp artist/businessmen understood this and they upped production knowing that the more walls their work was seen on, the more demand would rise. They also kept moving up their prices as they moved up their production, and both died wealthy men. If you can make yourself into a brand in a capitalist society, you can sell lots of art and move your prices up at the same time. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn the gallery world, the emblem of \\\"success\\\" is the posted price list, stickered with red dots. Who knows how many of these prices and dots are real -- dealers have been known to fudge the results a bit to heat up the market -- but doesn't  this price list for the works of Ross Blackener, posted at the Mary Boone gallery two years ago, stir up feelings of envy and competitiveness? If people are lining up to pay six-figure prices for Ross Bleckner's work it must be good, \\u003Cem\\u003Eright?\\u003C/em\\u003E Assumptions like that hold up the foundations all art transactions, as art has no real practical value. if your family was starving you would trade your Rembrandt for a ham sandwich to feed them... at least I hope you would. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-04-1433442509-6286052-Price_List.png.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-06-04-1433442509-6286052-Price_List.png.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-04-1433442509-6286052-Price_List.png-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"470\\\" height=\\\"567\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003ERoss Bleckner's price list: red dots indicate sales. \\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBefore the housing market crashed and burned in 2008 a friend leaned across the table at lunch and bragged to me about a recent real estate investment. \\\"My father told me,\\\" he explained,\\\"to buy California real estate because it never goes down.\\\" A few months later his father was proved very wrong -- at least momentarily -- and many people I know think that art is the next bubble, ready to burst when the world's billionaires lose confidence in art as suddenly as the Dutch once lost interest in tulip bulbs. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nUntil that happens, I say move your prices up. It's a shell game, I know, but it apparently works. If you find this advice cynical, keep in mind that if you are a modest person who doesn't brag about what you do and who is embarrassed by the idea of over-charging for what you do, you may actually deserve a raise.

Some in this group weren't natural allies -- they usually occupy opposite sides of many other issues. But they found common ground on this case and brought many thoughtful insights, along with their credibility, to bear in support of our shared position.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnd yes, all of this work by the Adventist Church was in support of a cause centered around a Muslim plaintiff, in a case that did not involve a member of our faith.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAmerica has long been described as a cultural \\\"melting pot\\\" and a look around virtually any office today confirms this reality. In an increasingly diverse work world, where colleagues can come from any corner of the globe and practice any faith -- including religions that may be unfamiliar to many of us -- it's more important than ever that we maintain constitutionally protected individual rights to religious freedom.

It's vast and open, unlimited in its potential reach. It's inclusive and welcoming. Anyone can be part of it and make a difference.

But as the Internet has expanded globally, it's become increasingly clear that one government cannot lay claim to it. The Internet is a worldwide resource. It belongs to everyone.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAppropriately, the U.S. Government has long understood the Internet's global potential. That's why it helped create the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) in 1998--a neutral, independent, and private-sector led organization designed to coordinate the Internet's domain name system functions. Its operations are not made under the direction of one government, but through a bottom-up, multi-stakeholder policy development process involving business, civil society, engineers, academics, everyday users, and \\u003Cem\\u003Emany\\u003C/em\\u003E governments (around 150 of them participate). Under that system, the Internet has flourished, connecting over 3 billion of us, through our billions of devices.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOver the past two decades, the U.S. Government has gradually lightened its touch in its stewardship over the key Internet domain name system functions operated by ICANN. These technical functions are known as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions. The U.S. Government is now prepared to give up stewardship over the IANA functions altogether.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut why? And why now?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe U.S. Government \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.icann.org/resources/unthemed-pages/white-paper-2012-02-25-en\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ealways envisioned\\u003C/a\\u003E that its role in the IANA functions would be temporary. In March of 2014, the U.S. Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.ntia.doc.gov/press-release/2014/ntia-announces-intent-transition-key-internet-domain-name-functions\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eannounced\\u003C/a\\u003E its intent to transition out of its stewardship of the IANA functions. In its announcement, NTIA cited its belief that ICANN as an organization has matured and improved its accountability, transparency and its technical competence. NTIA also asserted that the Internet, managed and driven by the global community of diverse stakeholders, is in very good hands.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe current model of Internet governance is the only one that can keep pace with the global expansion of users, including where, how, how often, and in what language they're using it. Continual evolution is key: Internet governance must evolve to meet the changing needs of all users to ensure the network remains available, open, stable, and secure. A report by Microsoft projects that the number of Internet users will grow to 4.7 billion in 2025, 75 percent of that growth coming from emerging economies. We must work together to take into consideration this changing landscape.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMany believe that if the U.S. Government does \\u003Cem\\u003Enot\\u003C/em\\u003E step aside, other governments, including some that are uncomfortable with an open and inclusive Internet, will step in to try to capture control of it through intergovernmental organizations. Alternatively, governments could become motivated to break away from the one, unified Internet to form their own national or regional networks, essentially fragmenting the Internet we know today. The result of this could be a patchwork of incompatible networks spread across different nation states, with long-term social, cultural, political, and economic casualties. Why take that chance?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe ICANN multi-stakeholder community brings together thousands of representatives from large and small businesses and civil society with technical experts, researchers, academics, and end users from all over the world. Our role at ICANN is to coordinate this community. We are neutral and independent facilitators.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMany stakeholders have been working tirelessly over the past year to meet NTIA's guidelines for the transition of their stewardship role to the global multi-stakeholder community. Since March 2014, the community has spent more than 400 hours together on calls and in meetings, working to develop a proposal that meets the following guidelines:\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Col\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\t\\u003Cli\\u003ESupports and enhances the existing multi-stakeholder model.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\t\\u003Cli\\u003EMaintains the security, stability, and resiliency of the Internet Domain Name System.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\t\\u003Cli\\u003EMeets the needs and expectations of the global customers and partners of the IANA services.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\t\\u003Cli\\u003EMaintains the openness of the Internet.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003C/ol\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThey also have to take into account that NTIA also specified that it would not accept a proposal that replaces NTIA's role with a government-led or intergovernmental organization solution.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nShould the transition fail, the United States could lose credibility in its quest to maintain an open, multi-stakeholder-driven Internet. The risk of fragmentation will grow and U.S. and global economies risk losing the commercial and social benefits inherent in the single, global, free, and open Internet where innovation happens, and on which we've all come to rely.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI invite you to please join our process.

According to one study, such efficiencies could give the region an estimated $400 billion economic boost in the first year alone. But the ambitions of Brussels policymakers are too small. A single European digital market should be just the first step in the creation of an open global digital market that will allow companies and individuals everywhere to continue to exploit the Internet's potential.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSuch a project may be the best way to reconcile the complex political and economic forces battling over the future of the Internet. Tired of American omnipotence, rising democracies like Brazil and India are rightly demanding a voice in how the Net is run. Meanwhile, countries that view information as a threat--China, Iran, Putin's Russia, and more--are trying to strangle and fragment the Internet. The United States is still suffering from the after effects of Snowden's NSA revelations. Both the U.S. government and its biggest companies are seen as arrogant giants eager to spread their dominance. Globally, the individuals who populate the Internet--sharing their lives, voicing their opinions, and selling their goods--increasingly question the powers that be.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhat should the basic principles be behind a global digital market--and how would we get there? First, any regulation of the Internet must be kept to the bare minimum necessary to protect the rights of users and the operations of online business. Attempts to impose static laws and rules on rapidly changing technology will do little but choke off economic and political possibilities.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSecondly, any new rules should reflect a bias toward the values of open markets and free expression. There have been many attempts to define and refine these values in the virtual world. One good example to follow are the tenets espoused by the \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.freedomonlinecoalition.com/\\\"\\u003EFreedom Online Coalition\\u003C/a\\u003E, a group of nations organized by the Netherlands that supports online freedom and human rights. Another are the guarantees for the unrestricted flow of information and data across borders that is being sought by members of the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.nftc.org/?id=1\\\"\\u003EU.S. National Foreign Trade Council\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe third principle: maximize participation in making the rules. All types of players from all sorts of places must be given a role. The U.S. and Europe can try to set the rules and then insist that others follow them. But such an approach is unrealistic and doomed to failure, not to mention \\u003Cem\\u003Eso\\u003C/em\\u003E 20\\u003Csup\\u003Eth\\u003C/sup\\u003E Century.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"All types of players\\\"--known to the cognoscenti by the inelegant phrase \\\"multi-stakeholder process\\\"--should certainly include the engineers and entrepreneurs who understand the power of the Internet better than the rest of us. And businesses should be ready to engage in the process. Those who argue that putting so many perspectives at the same table will produce nothing but cacophony ought look at the \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/\\\"\\u003EGlobal Network Initiative\\u003C/a\\u003E. The Initiative has brought together companies, human rights groups, investors, and academics in a far-from-perfect but nonetheless important attempt to protect online free expression and privacy.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"All sorts of places\\\" should encompass rising powers and emerging economies as well as the U.S. and Europe. After all, by 2025 more than 75 percent of the 4 billion Internet users will be from those countries. The somewhat clumsy but well-meaning attempt to include more nations in the governance of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers--the group that doles out addresses on the Internet--is a sign that steps are being taken to share power.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFourth, we must maximize opportunity for inventors, innovators, and entrepreneurs. In the world of technology, no figures are more mythical nor more important than the lonely geeks struggling to make real their ideas. Efforts to nurture that kind of talent have now spread to startup hubs around the world. It's our obligation to create an environment in which genius can flourish.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOther principles will also be important and even harder to reconcile: finding the balance between user privacy, commercial convenience, and national security; protecting the creative property of those who make art or music or develop new technology; and more. None of this will be easy.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut we can already see what will happen if those who support an open and free Internet fail to create a truly global digital market. Examine the Chinese government's Internet stranglehold; the army of Russian hackers who have sowed unrest in Ukraine; and the Iranian leaders who communicate to the world using Twitter while denying that platform to their citizens.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhile Europe continues to sort through some of these messy issues in the development of a single set of standards and regulations for a unified market, the E.U. would do well to pursue an open and transparent process. Inviting players from the rising powers as well as the U.S. as observers and contributors would not only go a long way to ensure a successful outcome, it would begin to lay out the kinds of principles that like-minded nations will one day have to negotiate on a global scale.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOur natural instincts have been to find the differences among us and seek an advantage against another country or company. But a digital future in which openness, privacy, economic growth, and free expression are protected is by no means guaranteed. The best way ahead is to come together to minimize the rules and maximize opportunities. Only then can we reconcile the swirl of technological, economic, and political change--and take full advantage of the technological wonders of the times in which we live.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EBob Boorstin is a senior vice president at Albright Stonebridge Group, an international advisory and commercial diplomacy firm that supports NGOs and leading multinational companies around the world.

Compliance is definitely a regulatory burden, and could become a nightmare.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAngel investors have long been required to \\u0026quot;certify through signature\\u0026quot; that their net worth or income qualifies them to become accredited, so their burden and risk haven't changed yet. Some investors fear that this new general solicitation rule will lead to bank statement or tax return disclosures, increase their burden, and may cause qualified angels to back out of the process. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAngel groups fear the loss of members for the same reason. Here again, the entrepreneur will be the one hurt most, by having fewer funding sources to access. I predict that angel investors, who are generally early adopters, will actually be quick to adapt to the new requirements and online systems, and will operate side by side with the new influx of non-accredited investors.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAfter all, investors of all types who fund entrepreneurs, starting with friends and family, have always been all about creating win-win situations. The investor wins only when the startup wins, and today's angels can only cover about 3 percent of funding requests. We have a long way to go, in this new era of the entrepreneur, before angel investors aren't needed.\\u003C/p\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T11:56:13-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marty-zwilling/angel-investors-are-still_b_7513292.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marty-zwilling/angel-investors-are-still_b_7513292.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 18:56:13 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Angel Investors Are Still The Lifeblood Of Startups"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 19:21:33 UTC +00:00]]

The jerk's name is Horace (because he's horrible), and he loves to make me doubt myself. When you spend every waking hour with someone, you tend to figure out how to push their buttons.

Where will society produce it? How much can we manage? Who will control it? What will they do to us with it? How can individuals retain influence over it? These are elemental questions for our era. They are questions that not only citizens, but government itself needs to be methodically asking. The dinner had nothing to do with our impending \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://techonomy.com/conf/policy/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ETechonomy Policy\\u003C/a\\u003E conference on June 9 in Washington D.C., but it's no coincidence that the opening session is entitled \\\"Keeping America Innovative In the Age of Data Exhaust.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe speakers for that session include Internet pioneer Vint Cerf and veteran tech leader Steve Case. We sustain that quality level all day. We'll hear from entrepreneur and investor Sean Parker, co-founder of Napster and Plaxo, founding president of Facebook, and now, co-creator of the Economic Innovation Group, an ambitious bi-partisan project to stimulate tech-savvy growth for the American economy.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nTechonomy Policy aims to help seed critical dialogue about the challenges for government as tech's progress accelerates. We've learned from our past events that there is an urgent need for innovators and policy makers to come together, to keep our economy moving forward and our country competitive. We aim to bring government leaders together with the innovators, entrepreneurs, and aggressive businesses driving such changes, in a constructive dialogue that doesn't gloss over the challenges.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOne guest at the New York dinner explained that he is a close student of his own personal health, and gets regular blood tests. Each time, he logs the results in a spreadsheet to track his health metrics. And where does he keep that spreadsheet? In Google Docs, of course. So, he asked, what if, in some not-distant future, he's driving along in a car controlled by Google's self-driving software, and a head-on collision is imminent? Could Google's algorithms instantly conclude he has little likelihood of long life, based on the spreadsheet, and sacrifice him in favor of the healthier occupant of the other vehicle?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHyperbole aside, what standards must data-owners abide by in a data-rich world? Who gets to use data? What will be our protections against data's misuse, and who will define misuse? Can government actively and continuously engage with such questions? Maybe we can begin to figure out government's role in situations like the Google Docs/driverless car example.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe data explosion is just one of a dauntingly numerous variety of tech transformations now underway that will overturn norms in commerce, behavior, health, public safety, and work. What about the Internet of Things, as intelligence, control, and yes, data accumulation increasingly surrounds us, literally? Or the Blockchain, that inscrutable new way to securely organize any sort of information with no central authority or oversight? It increasingly seems like the most important innovation surrounding the digital currency Bitcoin. We'll have multiple sessions devoted to both of these urgent topics at Techonomy Policy.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nEvery day's headlines underscore the need for unvarnished conversation between the changemakers and those who make policy and regulation. A guy who published online his plans for a 3D-printed gun is suing the State Department, which earlier ordered him to withdraw the documents because it said that publishing them was the export of military secrets. Now the guy's high-powered lawyers argue that he was just publishing computer code, and government is violating his freedom of speech.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOn another front, the Federal Aviation Administration is finally, slowly, loosening up its super-tight \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2015/05/07/the-faa-and-the-drone-industry-are-turning-over-a-new-leaf/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eregulation of drones\\u003C/a\\u003E.

The economy took off in the \\u0026#8217;90s, and at the same time the government instituted this kind of patriotic education campaign shifting the focus from socialist ideology to Chinese nationalism. There\\u0026#8217;s definitely a lot of substance to that story still, but I think it\\u0026#8217;s now less relevant.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EHow are Chinese millennials different from the previous generation?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe young people I talked to again and again say they care less about money. There\\u0026#8217;s less satisfaction with pure economic growth, with materialism. They are more interested in religion, environmentalism, journalism—things that fulfill a sense of meaning. They\\u0026#8217;re less inclined to parrot the party line. They\\u0026#8217;re more individualistic.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EOn attitudes toward the government\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EDo millennials buy into Xi Jinping\\u0026#8217;s Chinese Dream concept—are young people more immune to that hokey paternalism? \\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThere\\u0026#8217;s a funny story I heard from a young entrepreneur I talked to about this. A Beijing TV station wanted to do a TV segment on him as an example of an innovative entrepreneur living the Chinese dream. The guy was a total hippie—he had long hair, he was scruffy, he wore a t-shirt. They asked him about his schooling and he said, \\u0026#8220;Oh, I fought with teachers a lot in class.\\u0026#8221; They asked him about how he became innovative, and he said, \\u0026#8220;A lot of it probably came from my parents divorce.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe business he started was sort of like Pandora, except it matches music to your mood. His parents were divorced when he was really young and he used the piano to escape. He said that since his parents didn\\u0026#8217;t pressure him to study for the \\u003Cem\\u003Egaokao\\u003C/em\\u003E [the all-important college entrance exam] he was free to pour himself into creative pursuits—and that frame of mind about doing something different helped him found a startup.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EI bet that went over well!\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWell, at the end of the interview, the TV station producer basically told him his story didn\\u0026#8217;t fit with the theme of their Chinese dream series and the segment never ran. The entrepreneur said to me afterward, \\u0026#8220;The Chinese Dream should be about many people living their own dreams, not about what the Chinese leaders want us to do.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003E\\u0026#8220;The Chinese Dream should be about many people living their own dreams, not about what the Chinese leaders want us to do.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWhat about nationalism—is the government playing with fire a little by stoking it?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt is interesting to see youth out at these huge protests—the 2012 [Anti-Japan protests] were the biggest there has been since the \\u0026#8217;80s. But while young people who are very fervent patriots and nationalists have some overlap with the government agenda, at the same time, there\\u0026#8217;s a threat there that could be very dangerous for the government if it\\u0026#8217;s not handled correctly. This is something the government is worried about—that nationalistic protests could turn against them. It\\u0026#8217;s happened so many times in Chinese history: the May 4th movement, protests in 1935 against the Kuomintang government to stand up to Japan more. There was also a connection between the anti-Japan protests of 1985 that morphed into outrage about corrupt domestic leaders who were selling out their country [which eventually gave way to the Tiananmen protests].\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EIs Xi\\u0026#8217;s image as an anti-corruption crusader compelling to millennials?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFor sure. Xi is definitely giving off this image that he\\u0026#8217;s taking care of business. His anti-corruption campaign has been wildly popular with young people. How long that can last if more fundamental things don\\u0026#8217;t change, I don\\u0026#8217;t know. Anecdotally people are saying, \\u0026#8220;things are better, I don\\u0026#8217;t have to pay bribes anymore.\\u0026#8221; But are officials waiting out what they think is a temporary campaign? How much of this is permanent and systemic?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EDoes that imply more potential for popular protest?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt\\u0026#8217;s hard to imagine what would bring people together for any kind of movement, but it\\u0026#8217;s also really hard to judge these things until they happen. Like the Southern Weekend protests [demonstrations over government censorship of the prominent magazine Southern Weekend in 2013]—clearly media censorship was something a lot of people really cared about. The general thing that is happening is that young people are losing inhibitions to speak up, they\\u0026#8217;re demanding more from their leaders, and tolerance for incompetence, corruption, and injustice is shrinking.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAt the same time a lot of social and economic problems are getting worse—the economy and job situation are getting pretty dismal for them, the environment, the gender imbalance. If all those things ever intersect in some way, that could spell trouble. I have no idea what that would look like, but I think these trends are things that keep China\\u0026#8217;s leaders awake at night.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EYoung people are losing inhibitions to speak up.\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EHow effectively is the government managing youth outrage these days?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt depends on how you look at it. At the end of the Hu Jintao administration [from 2003 to 2013] there were all these street demonstrations and online movements and those have really been subdued. So in that it way, it really seems that Xi has been successful. But the more Xi [muzzles dissent] the more people he puts in contact with the coercive measures of the state.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe Feminist Five [that were jailed for more than a month in March after protesting sexual harassment on public transport] are a good example. They\\u0026#8217;d done these pretty innocuous demonstrations and they weren\\u0026#8217;t that political at all. But by imprisoning them for more than a month, it made a lot of people who only cared about very narrow feminist issues care about bigger political issues. And it brought others, including men, to the feminist cause. It\\u0026#8217;s a case study in what happens when the state escalates repression—is it going to last, or are they creating more problems for themselves in the long run?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EOn millennial entrepreneurism\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EPeople are talking about China and innovation right now. Are there experiences unique to Chinese millennials that make them more comfortable entrepreneurs?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI think it\\u0026#8217;s definitely a more entrepreneurial generation. Younger people who don\\u0026#8217;t have the memory of the hardships that their parents\\u0026#8217; generation did, they\\u0026#8217;re less afraid of taking that entrepreneurial plunge into something that could easily fail.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESo those who say Chinese can\\u0026#8217;t innovate—that\\u0026#8217;s absurd. There\\u0026#8217;s all kind of cool innovation happening everywhere you look. But at a society level, there are some huge roadblocks to innovation legally, politically, culturally. The young innovators that I talked to are still outliers. One 22-year-old entrepreneur I talk about in the book said a lot of the people he was working with on app development are not from China\\u0026#8217;s top universities because those graduates go directly into state-owned companies or Baidu or Tencent.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe culture has decided, if you\\u0026#8217;re at the top of your field you get a job at a big company—you don\\u0026#8217;t create something new. Graduates from the second-tier of schools are more inclined to start their own businesses. Launching a tech startup as a college grad or even dropping out of college—that was completely crazy not too long ago. But it becomes less insane when you see other people doing it.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EGraduates from the second-tier of schools are more inclined to start their own businesses.\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EHow much of that willingness to launch their own business is because it\\u0026#8217;s getting so hard for millennials to get jobs?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThat\\u0026#8217;s definitely a driver. In 2012, college graduate unemployment was 16%, which was double the US. And it gets worse every year. University degrees are devaluing quite quickly, so it\\u0026#8217;s definitely one motivator to do a startup.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EOn Tiananmen\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EIn general, how do millennials seem to view Tiananmen? Does it mean anything to them?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThere\\u0026#8217;s not this appreciation that people were protesting the government for a slew of reasons that threatened the government\\u0026#8217;s legitimacy enough that it saw fit to violently suppress them. But there\\u0026#8217;s also not as much of an appreciation of what the state is willing to do to keep power as what people maybe had 15, 20 years ago.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ETiananmen was suppressed way more violently than it needed to be. There had been large protests in years before that that were less violently broken up. When they used tanks and machine guns [around Tiananmen Square] the government sent a pretty effective message that it wasn\\u0026#8217;t going to tolerate protest anymore. But they then erased, or attempted to erase, Tiananmen. The side-effect is, the next generation that wasn\\u0026#8217;t around to receive that message—there\\u0026#8217;s not that fear that there once was about stepping out of line.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003ETiananmen just one of so many issues on which there\\u0026#8217;s no longer groupthink anymore.\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EYou say \\u0026#8220;attempted to erase\\u0026#8221;\\u0026#8230;\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe idea that it\\u0026#8217;s been totally erased from history in China is a bit overblown. Some people know entirely what happened. Most know that something happened—that people were killed in 1989—but they\\u0026#8217;re very sketchy on the details—why they were killed.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESome people I talked to, when I brought it up, they said, \\u0026#8220;Well they must have done something really bad,\\u0026#8221; like threatening the stability of the country. They think that the protesters must have been too uncompromising, and that the government had no choice.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut you ask 10 different people, you get 10 different answers. I\\u0026#8217;ve gotten responses that run the gamut from \\u0026#8220;what they did was absolutely correct\\u0026#8221; and \\u0026#8220;these were people trying to create chaos that needed to be put down,\\u0026#8221; all the way to the other extreme—the view that the massacre was unnecessarily brutal and stripped the Communist Party of its legitimacy.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EIs it kind of remarkable that you get such a range of responses?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ETiananmen is just one of so many issues on which there\\u0026#8217;s no longer groupthink anymore. It used to be you asked what people thought about some issue and they\\u0026#8217;d say the government line. Views on Tiananmen is a good example of that—of the diversity of opinions blooming in China.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003ESo Chinese millennials are \\u003Cem\\u003Enot\\u003C/em\\u003E \\u0026#8220;brainwashed\\u0026#8221;?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe in the West hear about Chinese censorship all the time. But time and again, even when I talked to young migrants or rural workers, they all seemed to have a fairly good understanding of what was going on—they\\u0026#8217;re aware of the same problems that we see.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHowever, they don\\u0026#8217;t necessarily see the same solutions, or make the connections between these problems and the political system the way [Westerners] are inclined to do. I don\\u0026#8217;t think there is any great willingness to shake up the system completely. A lot of people see value in stability.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EDo you see any parallels between the mood among young people now and in the late 1980s?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWell, look how Tiananmen was sparked. [The protesters] came out to grieve for a leader, Hu Yaobang, who was celebrated because he wasn\\u0026#8217;t corrupt, he didn\\u0026#8217;t put his children in high positions. He was the model who highlighted all the corruption in the system. The Weibo things [the exposure of corrupt officials on social media] that have blown up and gotten a lot of local officials fired—that might be helping people have more courage to speak out when they see something wrong. Online tools definitely create strength in numbers.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe comparison to today is useful in that in 1989 there were all sorts of different economic and social circumstances that contributed to people being willing to go out on the streets and push for change en masse.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnd the demonstrators weren\\u0026#8217;t pushing for what we think of as Western-style democracy; there were all these different things people were protesting, and in many ways, they weren\\u0026#8217;t united on them. Students were pushing for reforms to go fast, workers thought they\\u0026#8217;d gone too fast.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn the posters you see from Tiananmen—about freedom of speech and democracy—these concepts were popular, but there never seemed to be this notion of \\u0026#8220;we need to flip the system.\\u0026#8221; Today, I don\\u0026#8217;t see a huge clamoring for fundamental political overhaul either. The question is, will anything bring these different groups of young people together?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=420205\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/420205/26-years-after-tiananmen-chinese-millennials-are-forgetting-to-fear-their-government/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T12:18:35-07:00\",\"category\":\"China's Transition\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/420205\",\"dc_creator\":\"Gwynn Guilford\",\"media_content_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/china-millennial-tiananmen_crop.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"china millennial tiananmen_crop\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/china-millennial-tiananmen_crop.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/420205/26-years-after-tiananmen-chinese-millennials-are-forgetting-to-fear-their-government/"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 19:18:35 UTC +00:00], ["title", "26 years after Tiananmen, Chinese millennials are forgetting to fear their government"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 19:48:26 UTC +00:00]]

So while we are decidedly below D-list status, we would like to share \\u003Cem\\u003Eour\\u003C/em\\u003E advice for heading out into the big, bad, real world.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E1. Dating gets better. \\u003C/strong\\u003EWe know you've been told that college years are the best years of your life, and this may be true when it comes to, say, drinking until you fall over and facing zero repercussions when you sleep until four the next afternoon. But it's not true when it comes to dating. Your best dating years are ahead of you. Sure, you will experience some horrendous first dates -- probably many. And we're fairly sure you will also suffer at least one heart-rending breakup -- an experience so bad that you will want to curl up in a ball in your bathtub and never come out. But, in general, people in their 20s and 30s are much better at dating than college kids. For one thing: They actually date.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E2. Monogamy doesn't come naturally.\\u003C/strong\\u003E It takes work. If you decide that monogamy is for you -- and \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://emandlo.com/2010/10/top-10-reasons-for-being-and-staying-monogamous/\\\"\\u003Ewe highly recommend it\\u003C/a\\u003E -- then you're going to have to work to buttress it. In other words, don't put yourself in temptation's way -- no boozy late-night drinks with former booty calls.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E3. Monogamy isn't for everyone.\\u003C/strong\\u003E And that's okay. What's not okay is pretending you're good with monogamy, and then lying and cheating your way through a supposedly monogamous relationship. If you're not ready to be with just one person -- and maybe you'll never be ready for this -- then \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://emandlo.com/2010/10/top-10-reasons-for-being-and-staying-non-monogamous/\\\"\\u003Eexplore the possibilities of non-monogamy\\u003C/a\\u003E. Like monogamy, it has many pros, and like monogamy, it takes work.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E4. Condoms are more important than sunscreen. \\u003C/strong\\u003EOkay, so sunscreen is important, too, especially when sunbathing naked (ouch), but condoms matter, too.  Also, get tested for STDs frequently, and be honest about your sexual history. And get that HPV vaccine! It's not too late.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E5. We don't care what the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://time.com/3700935/princeton-mom-alumni-susan-patton-sexual-assault/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EPrinceton Mom\\u003C/a\\u003E says: Rape is not a \\\"learning experience.\\\"\\u003C/strong\\u003E In case you didn't learn this in college (and current statistics suggest you probably haven't): Even if you know the person, even if you're drunk, even if you're on a date with them -- if you don't want to have sex and the person continues, then it's rape. With or without duct tape. And if anyone (ahem, Princeton Mom) attempts to call it \\\"a clumsy hookup melodrama\\\" or a \\\"fumbled attempt at a kiss or a caress,\\\" then you just tell them to go back to the seventies where they belong. This is 2015, and rape is rape.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E6. Being good at sex is like studying for a test:\\u003C/strong\\u003E Sure, there are some general test-taking skills that are useful to know, but to really ace a test, you need knowledge specific to that test. Put it this way: Just as someone who says they're \\\"a really good test taker\\\" won't necessarily ace the MCATs if they didn't take any pre-med classes, so someone who thinks they're \\\"good in bed\\\" won't necessarily be able to please their partner if they don't know that partner's quirks and wants. So ask questions, and listen to the answers. Pay attention to body language and moans and groans, too. Consider each new sexual experience a blank slate (but not in that \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://emandlo.com/2013/01/top-10-breakup-songs-wed-like-to-see-taylor-swift-write/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ETaylor Swift\\u003C/a\\u003E way).\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E7. You don't have to like \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.emandlo.com/tag/casual-sex\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ecasual sex\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/strong\\u003E Sure, you might feel way too young to settle down, but that doesn't mean that you have to embrace one-night stands and drunken booty calls if that's not your thing. Serial monogamy has its perks, too -- and if you believe point #6, above, then this may just lead to better sex.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E8. But if you enjoy casual sex, don't let anyone shame you for this.\\u003C/strong\\u003E Especially if you're a woman. As long as everyone in bed is being safe and honest and having fun, it's all good.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E9. Think twice before texting a nude photo of yourself.\\u003C/strong\\u003E Consider cropping your face if you just can't resist. Here's a rule of thumb: if you're not ready to introduce the recipient to your parents, then it's probably a bad idea to trust them with your dirty pics.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E10. That said, no matter what you think of the body you have now, one day you will look back on it in awe\\u003C/strong\\u003E, so consider preserving it for posterity. Ask your partner -- or even a good friend! -- to shoot you nude. Better yet, get a professional to do the job. You'll thank us later.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E11. Porn is not worth losing a partner over, no matter where you stand on the issue. \\u003C/strong\\u003EThere's always a \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://emandlo.com/2015/04/why-marriage-vows-should-include-sex/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ecompromise\\u003C/a\\u003E to be found.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E12. If you like someone, just ask them out already.\\u003C/strong\\u003E That goes double for you ladies.  If they think you're desperate or needy for asking, then screw them and the insecure horse they hobbled in on.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E13. There's no such thing as normal in bed\\u003C/strong\\u003E, whether you're graduating a virgin or you like to role-play in a sweater vest in bed. There's only what you like... and what you don't.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E14. You don't have to be friends with all your exes\\u003C/strong\\u003E, and you certainly don't have to be Facebook friends with them. But \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Em-Lo/155982167766857\\\"\\u003Eyou should be Facebook friends with us\\u003C/a\\u003E (and we'll never break your heart).\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E15. In the best relationships, sex keeps getting better.\\u003C/strong\\u003E But this is not an excuse to settle for someone you don't have chemistry with -- sex can't get \\u003Cem\\u003Ethat\\u003C/em\\u003E much better.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E16. Lube is not a crutch.\\u003C/strong\\u003E We're not joking. You may be young and nubile, but that's no guarantee that the rivers will be flowing down there. There's no shame in reaching for that pump dispenser -- in fact, it makes sex better for everyone.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E17. Don't ever do something in bed just to get someone to like you.\\u003C/strong\\u003E It won't work, and it'll just make you feel shitty in the morning. This goes for blowjobs, getting kinky, taking nude pics, or just plain sleeping with someone.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E18. About once a millennium, a booty call matures into a real relationship.\\u003C/strong\\u003E You are not the exception to this rule.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E19. It's okay to like Taylor Swift.\\u003C/strong\\u003E Ditto \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/05/there-is-only-one-direction.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EOne Direction\\u003C/a\\u003E, or rom coms, or putting ketchup on your steak. The easiest way to find people -- both friends and lovers -- who like you for who you really are is to be yourself.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E20. Write your own damn commencement speech.\\u003C/strong\\u003E We're serious: actually write something down. Or, whatever, type it if you can't remember how to hold a pen. Pick ten or twenty things that you want to remember, or things you want to do, or things you swear you'll never do. Repeat every June, and pay attention to the things that appear year after year. This is more important than anything a commencement speaker has to say. Except condoms -- and sunscreen on your naughty bits.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-04-1433433273-6459585-graduation_college.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-06-04-1433433273-6459585-graduation_college.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-04-1433433273-6459585-graduation_college-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"570\\\" height=\\\"353\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003C/center\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T13:03:24-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/em-and-lo/top-20-tips-for-graduating-college-students_b_7511714.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/em-and-lo/top-20-tips-for-graduating-college-students_b_7511714.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:03:24 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Top 20 Tips for Graduating College Students"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:20:11 UTC +00:00]]

So in 2011, I decided to learn the game of polo after watching a Ralph Lauren commercial. The only issue was that I was a rocket scientist-turned-CEO who never rode a horse before, and I knew nothing about the sport. To better explain, riding a polo pony as a beginning equestrian is equivalent to learning how to drive a manual transmission on an Italian luxury sports car.  However, after learning how to ride horses and play polo, I was introduced to a new form of humanitarian influence where philanthropy, polo charm and science would all meet.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn Los Angeles on May 30, 2015, the 2nd Annual British Polo Day USA was the event where magic came alive.

Greatness is defined by breaking away from the norm.  Many times in life, we simply must decide to leave our comfort zone and master something that will transform us. This principle holds true in my life, for organizations, and in your life.  My love for polo came after I decided to become a beginner again. Now I am a skilled equestrian, and I play polo for fun. Who knew that learning how to ride a horse would unlock doors for humanitarian philanthropy?  Invoke the \\\"newness\\\" principle.  What can you learn today?  What personal doors will you unlock?   What will inspire you? How will you inspire greatness?

A new coat of gold paint doesn't fool anyone. I'm on my morning jog, 111th Street to Compton to Imperial to Central Avenue. The morning quiet is pierced by a police siren. I hurry home so as not to be confused with the suspects. My aunty is already outside watching four young boys not past 12 years of age being chased by the LAPD. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt's a sight way too common in my neighborhood. I know these kids and though I don't know what they've done this morning I know why they're in trouble. They've succumbed to their own greed and want -- to fit an image they've seen on television and social media. They need the latest Jordans, designer belts, jewelry, etc. The only way they can feed these desires is to rob people or sell drugs.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnd run.

The loss of one mother's son is a loss to them all but it's much worse if it's their own. The police are gone now, chasing after those boys who are chasing after their twisted idea of who they want to be, and I'm back outside to run my second mile.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA few buildings down, I almost step on a small red toy car jutting out of the weeds. I bend and snatch it up. This is no ordinary toy car, or at least it belongs to no ordinary kid. This is Lil Don Don's toy car and Lil Don Don is the hope of my neighborhood. He is the faith of my community. Lil Don Don is the last kid left. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThere are plenty of kids running around my community, but none like Don Don. He is the epitome of what a kid his age should be doing, how a ten-year-old boy should act and how he should be thinking. He's the only kid his age who hasn't seen the inside of a squad car. While other kids his age are plotting illicit schemes to get the new Jordans, Don Don is at his parents' bedroom door asking for the new video game he's had his heart set on for the past two weeks. The rest of the neighborhood kids have already been molded into tomorrow's \\\"gangsters\\\" and most of them seem to be in too deep to reverse the curse of hood politics. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENo one notices how special Don Don is to the community. His innocence is power. His peers think he's \\\"scared to get money,\\\" \\\"a punk\\\" because he doesn't want to hang out all night but would rather be in his room building sculptures out of Legos. He's a dreamer, a visionary, the hope of the future. His dreams haven't been crushed. Not yet. In his mind everything is still possible. He just hasn't done it yet. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDon Don looks nothing like me, but when I see him I see myself. At his age I too saw no benefit in hanging and heading in the wrong direction. I knew which way I wanted to go and it seemed as if my friends were just going in a different direction. By the age of 12, I had lost most of them to the law. We grew apart. We still see each other, but there isn't much to talk about. I stayed in school while they dropped out. I applied to college while they went to jail or managed to stay one step ahead of the police. I see the same happening to Don Don. I hope he can keep his innocence and I hope he can stay out of trouble.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI've got to hurry to school but on the way I bring Don Don his small red toy car. His friends are crowding his front door. They are urging him to come outside. I can hear what they're talking about. Seems that Don Don didn't get the money from his parents for his new video game and is considering joining his friends to get the cash he needs. I reach around them to hand Don Don his toy car and watch him find twenty dollars inside of it. The cash astonishes him and his innocence returns and he's like a kid who just checked under his pillow after the tooth fairy was there. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EImmediately he lets his old friends he doesn't need to go with them anymore. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThey walk off mumbling insults -- \\\"Punk!\\\" \\\"Bitch!\\\" \\\"He scary...\\\"\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThat $20 is my lunch money for the week.

Fitzgerald said, \\\"Your loan may be sold to a debt buyer. In fact, it may be sold several times. Your chances of success (defined as paying less than 100%) increases dramatically.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut consumers who were sued by National Collegiate over student loan debt and who have demanded to see the proof they own the debt have won in Ohio, Florida,and Kentucky. And cases in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania have proved to be trouble for National Collegiate Student Loan Trust, as well. In California there is a pending class-action lawsuit against National Collegiate over these same issues.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nGreg Reichenbach, who contacted me, was quoted in the Bloomberg article. \\\"The suits didn't assert that National Collegiate owned the loans, and after Beverly appealed, National Collegiate was unable to produce any documents indicating it owned them. \\\"The whole basis for the lawsuit is that they are entitled to enforce this alleged debt, and they don't even claim that they were assigned the debt, let alone prove it,\\\" says Reichenbach, who handled Beverly's appeal.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut asking for proof the debt buyer has the authority to collect on a debt is not a luxury, it is your right.

I over ran the bag but the fielder bobbled it. Without thinking I slid back and tagged the bag. Safe! \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHooray!\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOh wait. My leg. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe field we play on isn't exactly Fenway Park. The infield is made up of small little sharp gray pebbles. Skin sliding on sharp pebbles equals pain. My leg was ripped to shreds and bleeding. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut the high I felt being safe outweighed the pain, temporarily. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe next day when I stood the blood rushed to the now oozing injury and walking on it caused anguish.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSome would say I never learn. I tend to give everything I've got, my blood if you will, for my job, my kids, my friends, my team. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYes, there is a certain happiness I receive in doing good things for others. I definitely liked the street creds I got for sacrificing my body in my softball game. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut the aftermath, when I've given everything I can, I experience pain. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI wonder why I do it. What inside me needs to give to the point of emotionally exhaustion? I love too deeply, I care too much, I'm too sensitive...these are all words that have been used to describe me. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI'm too honest, I reveal too many things, I say too much. Why did you slide when you didn't have to? What did you expect? \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYou are wounded too easily. You don't react to things well. You need to be stronger, let things slide. You need to not care so much. Don't invest so much of yourself. You are a walking open wound.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut I am reactive. I don't think before I tear open my leg to slide safely into second base. I burst into tears when someone says something unkind, even if I'm in public. I feel everything, every slight, every hurt.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIt would definitely be a heck of a lot easier to not feel so much pain, but I also feel everything deeply when good things happen too. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI get goose bumps when I see an elderly couple holding hands as they walk together down the street. I take a genuine interest when someone shares with me how their child learned how to play guitar from an instrument purchased for three bucks at a yard sale and is now going to college on a musical scholarship. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n I feel. My shredded leg is throbbing three days later. My heart is forever broken from the one who walked away. I still remember how my grandfather looked at my grandmother when he told her, \\\"I married the most beautiful girl in the world,\\\" on his deathbed. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI feel. Love fills my heart when my son is in the outfield playing baseball and looks over at me with a goofy smile or when my daughter holds my hand and gives me three squeezes silently representing \\\"I-Love-You.\\\" \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThere are no walls. I feel. Maybe it does make me weak, but maybe my vulnerability creates a strength that is harder to see. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T12:59:49-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/heather-gillisharris/having-emotions-is-sometimes-a-sign-of-strength_b_7502564.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/heather-gillisharris/having-emotions-is-sometimes-a-sign-of-strength_b_7502564.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 19:59:49 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Having Emotions Is Sometimes a Sign of Strength"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:20:11 UTC +00:00]]

In a now viral \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T7du27rSDI\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Evideo\\u003C/a\\u003E, NBA star Stephen Curry holds his toddler daughter Riley on his lap during a press interview. His daughter then proceeds to steal the show. Throughout the video, she interrupts her dad, puts her face to the microphone, and walks slowly out of a curtain. All while her dad sits patiently.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSome people are outraged, calling for new NBA policy to keep little kids out of the pressroom, while others see this as a glimpse of a real, loving dad, who happens to be one of the biggest basketball stars on the planet.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYou know what I thought about as I watched the video? I wish more people did this.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe often get stuck like fish swimming in the waters of our lives. We do things to make ourselves look good, to be someone everyone thinks we should be, even at the cost of compromising who we really are. We don't know these things are holding us back, because we've let it become normal.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut a rare few, like Stephen, change things. Here are six things you should start doing today, while you still can.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E1. Start Connecting\\u003C/strong\\u003E \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI have three little children at home and each one is special to me. But here's how it sometimes has gone when I've headed home from work...\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI get in the car: \\\"This is awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing my kids.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHalfway home: \\\"But I've really got to finish up \\u003Cem\\u003Ethat one\\u003C/em\\u003E project.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAlmost home: \\\"Not sure how much time I'll have for them.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOpening door: \\\"Hey, daddy's home!\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBefore they go to bed: \\\"Let's read your favorite book together...\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMe going to bed at night: \\\"That. Was. Awesome. I wish I could spend all my time with them.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThey say that life is all about relationships. But our distracted brains don't agree. They want more texting, more email, and more ways to impress the boss. There's plenty of stuff out there to get in the way of life.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWho matters most to you? What's holding you back from connecting with them? Remember why they're so important and let \\u003Cem\\u003Ethem \\u003C/em\\u003Ebe your motivation and part of accomplishing and celebrating your goals, and life will be more meaningful.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E2. Start Being Bold\\u003C/strong\\u003E \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nEver heard the saying, \\\"The bold will rule the future?\\\" Seriously, it's true. Sticking with what you believe means everything. Don't be too scared to start things nobody's ever done before because it appears impossible.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nStarting that new exercise approach is going to take more than average interest. And every day you put it off is another day you lose respect for yourself. By waiting to pursue your goals, especially those that make you healthier and happier, you become less of who you can be. Will that person in the mirror be any stronger if you don't do what it takes? Be bold.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E3. Start Sleeping More\\u003C/strong\\u003E \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhen people brag to me about how little sleep they get and how much they can do without it, it makes me want to slam my head into a wall. You need to get plenty of sleep. There are very few exceptions to this, and most of us \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need/page/0/1\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Eneed \\u003C/a\\u003Eseven or eight hours of renewing, health-restoring sleep.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYou are not so busy you can avoid sleep. That boss isn't forcing you to work midnight hours. And it's not worth waiting months or years to get carted off in an ambulance to discover the benefits of sleep you've been missing.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E4. Start Saying No\\u003C/strong\\u003E \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMy friend Steve Toronto reminded me recently that anytime we're not willing to say no, we're saying yes to other things. So when you say yes to that night out, you're saying no to \\u003Cinsert more important activity\\u003E.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhen you say no to less vital things, you gain power. That goes for saying no to everything from stupid TV shows to extra work that nobody even cares you're doing.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E5. Start Serving More\\u003C/strong\\u003E \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI talked to a friend recently who was looking for career advice. He told me he needed help getting into the right company doing what he enjoys. I asked him, \\\"Do they know how you'll best serve \\u003Cem\\u003Etheir \\u003C/em\\u003Eneeds?\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nService is powerful, and always precedes success.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E6. Start Listening\\u003C/strong\\u003E \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nTalk less, and give people the attention they crave. Be like Stephen Curry who's showing the world he listens to his adorable daughter, but also wants the world to know he listens to her.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nStart today making your life everything it can be, and the rewards will be there.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhat above do you feel you could do more of? Would love to hear your thoughts.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EI really appreciate you taking the time to read this post.

This time, it's that taboo topic of age. So many people, particularly in the media, apparently feel that women of a certain age should go quietly into the night and rest on their laurels. Actresses have been complaining for years that once they hit 50 there are no substantial roles. Meanwhile, Liam Neeson continues to be in every action movie involving a daughter. Madonna won't rest on her laurels though, as that has never been her M.O.

It's your own problem. It's the mindset some have that women of a certain age should act a certain way, look a certain way and talk a certain way. In fact, if you have a problem with Madonna and what she does, it's only \\u003Cem\\u003Eyour \\u003C/em\\u003Eproblem that you've created in \\u003Cem\\u003Eyour\\u003C/em\\u003E mind. There's no rule book that says that on a certain magical date you must suddenly stop wearing clothes that you like and must suddenly wear clothes that you don't like because society says so. The truth is, society doesn't get to say so. This isn't a woman who's chasing trends, this is a woman who starts them. If you think she's going to listen to the countless talking heads droning on about how a woman should live her life, then you've clearly been living under a rock the last 30+ years. Those some people will praise U2 or Rolling Stones, while chastising Madonna. And Madonna's the only one of them still cranking out hits. This is an artist who's latest single, Ghosttown, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6568259/madonna-45th-number-1-dance-club-songs\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Ebecame her 45th #1 hit\\u003C/a\\u003E. After all, \\\"Bitch she's Madonna.\\\" \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAs so often happens with Madonna, controversy has overshadowed the music... and that's quite a shame. \\u003Cstrong\\u003ERebel Heart\\u003C/strong\\u003E, her latest album, is one of the best albums of her career.

She's going to be her, unapologetically. And when you can go out to the club with your friends at 56 years old and look absolutely amazing in what you're wearing as you dance the night away, you can thank Madonna.

Remember EOS, MaxJet, and SilverJet? MGM Grand, and Midwest Express with its all first-class planes and warm cookies baked on board? Or Singapore Airlines' 18-hour non-stops between LA and Newark to Singapore operated by specially modified all-business class Airbuses? And, of course, the Concorde was all premium seating. All ended in tears or with a whimper.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut British Airways seems to have figured it out. Twice a day in each direction, BA operates its \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.britishairways.com/en-us/information/airport-information/london-city\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ELondon City service\\u003C/a\\u003E between New York's JFK and London City Airport in the eastern reaches of the capital. Airbus A318's, specially modified to hold extra fuel, carry a maximum of 32 souls in 2-by-2 configured, fully-horizontal seats, and a cabin crew of three, although usually fewer passengers board each flight, especially in summer when business travel peters out.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAs the closest thing that many of us will ever come to flying \\\"private\\\" in a cocoon of exclusivity, BA appropriately re-used the Concorde's flight numbers (001, 002, 003, and 004) and while there are some trade offs compared to flying BA's Club World business class to and from Heathrow on 777, 747, and A380 aircraft, the pluses far outweigh them.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI've flown the London City service several times round-trip and it's my favorite way to fly to London. On two recent flights, every passenger had a row to himself (and it was mostly men), for extra privacy and comfort. You can check in at London City as few as 15 minutes before departure if just carrying cabin bags, or 20 minutes if checking a bag. Security lines are always short.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOn my most recent trip I was staying at the historic \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://pilotgreenwich.co.uk/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EPilot Inn\\u003C/a\\u003E, a little pub-with-rooms in Greenwich, and took a 20-minute cab ride (in rush hour) to the airport, so I left my room 60 minutes before take off (try that if flying from Heathrow) and still waited in the lounge for 15 minutes. Compare that to the hour-long ride to Heathrow, and the much longer check-in times required and the longer security lines. So you save a lot of time on the ground, especially if you're staying in the City or near Canary Wharf. Boarding and deplaning is much faster, too, than on a jumbo (it usually takes all of 5 minutes). And because City is such a small airport take off and landing delays, in contrast to Heathrow, are almost unheard of.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe minuses? Well, one is not really a minus depending on how you look at it. Westbound flights land in Shannon for a 35-minute refueling stop (that's because London City's shorter runways can't accommodate a fully-fueled A318 for take off). But the earlier BA 001 flight is cleared at U.S. customs and immigration at Shannon while the plane refuels, so you land as a domestic passenger at JFK. Tiny Shannon has almost non-existent immigration lines (and friendlier U.S border agents as well). True, there's no in-flight entertainment system on these planes (you get an iPad with a limited selection of media); the lounge at City is nothing like the Terraces at Heathrow (but then, you don't spend much time waiting in it); and if your final destination is the West End then City is no easier to reach than Heathrow.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut there are many pluses besides the convenience and greater privacy. For one, cabin crew love flying these flights so service is a notch above the usual business class norm--even more attentive and speedier. In fact, in some ways I prefer it to first class on a larger plane. But I think the best thing about London City flights is that it's a classless society. No first, no premium econ, no econ. We're all in the same boat--or plane. You don't feel \\\"guilty\\\" as the econ passengers pass by your luxury seat or envious as you pass by those in first class. It's Marxism for the one or two percent.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut wait, you don't have to be the one percent to experience it. If you're using your BA Avios points it's often easier to find business class London City award seats than to Heathrow. And those points are easy to earn: BA has offered in the past 100,000 mile bonus offers with its affiliated credit card, and you can earn miles in dozens of other ways. So play your points right and anyone can experience the best way to fly to London. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T12:55:30-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/george-hobica/the-best-way-to-fly-new-y_b_7513862.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/george-hobica/the-best-way-to-fly-new-y_b_7513862.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 19:55:30 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The Best Way to Fly New York to London"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:20:11 UTC +00:00]]

She counts among her fans Cher, Elton John and Madonna (who once described her as \\\"cruelly funny\\\"), and has a huge international fan base both flight attendant and gay. Now living in New York City, Pam (otherwise known as Caroline Reed) takes to the stage in elaborate outfits recalling the \\\"futuristic\\\" flight attendants outfits of the 1960s to mid-1970s, if the flight attendants were a bit into drag. Her big hair and makeup don't come close to overshadowing her huge personality, which Pam wields with abandon on stages worldwide. One could think that a comedy routine based largely on air travel might run out of material, but after over a decade it's clear that Pam Ann has tapped into something more. I caught up with Pam/Caroline as she was gearing up for a couple weeks of shows at the Triad Theater in New York City. Take a look at what she had to say about everything from growing up a goth in Melbourne to the prop newspapers in the first class cabin.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E How different is Pam now than when she first started in show business?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWell, she was a lot sweeter back in the day! She never swore or cursed. She also wasn't traveled -- she'd only been to Greece, with her Greek lover who flew her there. She hadn't really explored the world yet. I always say, as the airports got bigger so did her ego, and her mouth got filthier too. She's a real cunt now. She started off not quite twee nice, she would have been a bitch, but you would have been able to approach her. Not anymore.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EYou've traveled all over the world performing. How much of your material changes depending on the city you're in?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe material changes a lot. The top of the show is pretty on the fly. For example in Paris, It's all about the French. I tell the French they're a bunch of cunts in the best way -- the ultimate cunts. The ultimate cunt is a French Parisian. I open up my show there by saying, \\\"How many of you can understand what I'm saying?\\\" They all look at me and say, \\\"Oui! Oui!\\\" Then I just go, \\\"Well how the fuck is it now you understand me, but earlier when I walked up to you and asked you for directions you walked off like you didn't know a word!\\\" That's what I tell them, and they love it!\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EClass is a major theme of Pam's comedy. What do you think makes humor aimed at being seated in economy so successful with your audiences?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYou know, people get upset if they don't get first class. The cheap bitches are at the back. I was inspired by Dame Edna, who does a bit about \\\"the paupers upstairs.\\\" A lot of my work is inspired by Barry Humphries, really. It's a hard bit to do when everyone is standing, though. It's like, \\\"Oh, are we on an Air India flight today?\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EThough you're a live comic, your show is much more of a production than a typical stand-up set. What's the most difficult part of traveling with so many elements to your performance?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWell at the Triad (in New York City) we don't have much of a setup. It's just my food-cart; it's a low-key gig. But for the big shows it's much different. To be honest with you, when you're touring it's very hard to do any big sets. We travel with great lighting (we have a great lighting designer) and we travel with the lights and a screen projector. That's all I really bring with me on the road. That and my assistant/therapist. Honestly, I have no idea why she's still with me... she should have died by now. She's a lesbian Dutch girl; I'm always quite tempted too when we get drunk. And then we have a production manager, this big strapping guy who is really straight. You can smell him, he smells like straight person. He's probably got hairy balls. He's in London though; I have different teams for different places. When I'm in Europe I have this team of crazy Austrians that I can't understand at all. I'm like ...\\\"Sure, we'll go with that!\\\" In Australia I have LiveNation, which is just a whole other bitch. It's like, \\\"Can I have-\\\" \\\"Yes. Done. Done.\\\" They've got so much power, they're like the mafia or something!\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EYou've described yourself as a, \\\"delusional freak who was once a goth.\\\" How does a delusional freak/goth transform into a delusional glamorous airline hostess?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI was a goth! I used to get chased by a gang called the Sharpies. Google it -- Sharpies Melbourne, Victoria [I did -- \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.google.com/search?q=sharpies+melbourne\\u0026espv=2\\u0026biw=1242\\u0026bih=606\\u0026source=lnms\\u0026sa=X\\u0026ei=GnFuVemVFMLjoATkjIK4Bg\\u0026ved=0CAYQ_AUoAA\\u0026dpr=1.1\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Echeck it out\\u003C/a\\u003E]. They wore really tight jeans, very Tom of Finland really when you look at it, very homoerotic. They used to chase me because I was a goth. They would open up moving train doors and creepily go, \\\"You getting out here, Cleopatra?\\\" There were like full on crazy-ass Nazi gangs out in the suburbs, and then little old goths like me who were just getting into New Romantics and Boy George. I was just coming from the club with my tube skirt on, I didn't want to get off the train early! They're like, \\\"Run!\\\" and I was just like, \\\"Fuck!\\\" trying to run in my pointy-ass shoes. I was running like a geisha girl like, fuck me! I think that's what made me a bit of a cunt later in life too -- a cunt in the guise of an air hostess.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EThere is a long history of Australian comedy, especially when it's gay-orientated, having a cult following in the states. Dame Edna, Christopher Lilly and his bevy of characters, and of course the iconic drag film \\u003Cem\\u003EPriscilla, Queen of the Desert \\u003C/em\\u003Eall hail from Australia. Why do you think this niche of Australian comedy is so successful?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI think they were all molested. You know all that sparkle and glitter... there's something really dark there for sure. I mean... I'm just joking. It's just so camp out in Australia. Camp, and also racist. You've got both spectrums. You've got absolute racist redneck assholes, and then you've got campery \\u003Cem\\u003Ebeyond\\u003C/em\\u003E. I think there's glitter in the water in Australia, seriously. Then you've got pop princess Kylie Minogue... I don't know, is she on Xanax constantly? Because that girl is \\u003Cem\\u003Ealways\\u003C/em\\u003E nice. She's like a fembot or something. I have to admit that I'd take Madonna over Kylie. Don't get me wrong, I \\u003Cem\\u003Elove\\u003C/em\\u003E Kylie, but nothing beats a real sinewy cunt like Madonna.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWhat is the absolute worst audience you've ever had, and how did you handle it?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnything corporate is going to be your worst nightmare. One of my worst was in Melbourne years ago for football. Anything to do with sports -- football, tennis. God only knows why they ask me, knowing that I snort cocaine on stage. I did that at the Australian open, and they were like pulling me off the stage because I pulled out a gigantic bag of coke at the press launch. Then I made the papers for what happened at the Australian Football Dinner. I came out with aerosol cans (because back in the day, Qantas would go through the planes and spray all the foreigners to \\\"get rid of all the insects\\\"), and they thought I was a stripper. Like, my skirts around my knees! If I was a stripper I'd be wearing hot pants or something, I'd really work it. I was booed, and then physically taken off stage. There's this famous sports guy named Eddie McGuire who wrapped it all up and said, \\\"Well that was a big air disaster.\\\" \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI also did a gig in Dubai once. Anything that says the words \\\"Rugby,\\\" \\\"Children's Charity,\\\" and \\\"Dubai\\\" together... don't do it. They looked at me just like, \\\"Don't you dare!\\\" and I was just like, \\\"OK!\\\" I couldn't exactly show up and go, \\\"Oh, hi! Cunt cunt fuck, fisting, gay gay gay!\\\" because it's Dubai and you... can't really be gay! It's just really hard for me -- I can't not say cunt. Even if I try, it just comes out harder. Anyway, I was doing the show and I had to wrap it up -- if you see a guy in all white it's a problem. The sheikhs or something, very serious you know. I saw the guy standing there in the white robe and finished up super-fast, and ran right over to him apologizing. He just looked at me and said, \\\"You were fabulous!\\\" I think he was gay and wanted me to come sit with him at his table or something.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-03-1433302434-1286029-pam201421.jpeg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-06-03-1433302434-1286029-pam201421.jpeg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-03-1433302434-1286029-pam201421-thumb.jpeg\\\" width=\\\"380\\\" height=\\\"570\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EPhoto by pamann.com\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EIf I was getting on a plane tomorrow and had no choice but to fly economy, what advice would Pam give me to help me get through the ordeal of my flight?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFlying in economy is hideous. Always. If I was you next time, in America I'd fly on JetBlue. It's a fucking amazing airline. You've got way more space, the terminal at JFK is beautiful, the seats are nice, and the crew is young and friendly. It's really easy. I think it's the way forward. On their LA routes now you also have their new mint class -- which is your own suite. You can just close the door and it's just you. It's really perfect, like first class on Emirates or something. You can start off with watching \\u003Cem\\u003EWendy Williams\\u003C/em\\u003E and land in L.A. just after \\u003Cem\\u003EEllen\\u003C/em\\u003E. All the gay entertainment covered! You sit there and watch the television and then it's, \\\"Oh fuck, I'm in L.A.!\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EDo you think the flight attendants on Virgin America are equal to the ones on Virgin Atlantic?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nNo. On Virgin America they just don't really get it. I got in so much trouble with Virgin America's crew. I flew on Virgin America out of JFK. There's no lounge in JFK first of all -- you're paying two or three thousand dollars for a seat, there's no fucking lounge. It's a bit Mickey Mouse, too. As I was boarding the plane, the flight attendant was \\u003Cem\\u003Eeating\\u003C/em\\u003E, just had her mouth full of cookies or whatever. It  was horrifying, and then she just vanished! I tweeted something about her eating as we were boarding... and I was just joking alright, people are so easily offended these fucking days! I'll give them something to be fucking offended about. Anyway, everyone freaked out and was like, \\\"How dare you! Crew needs to eat as well! We thought you were on our side!\\\" I was just like, \\\"I'm not on anyone's side. I just paid for a ticket you bunch of cunts!\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThen another girl was doing this horrible dance routine thing, \\\"Yo yo yo, people, Virgin America in the house!\\\" so I of course videoed that and posted it too, which everyone got all fucked up and thought I was posting a video of the girl who was eating and that I was trying to shame her. I'm just like, \\\"No!!! That's a whole other subject!\\\" By that point social media had gone so crazy there was no point in even trying to defend myself. Then I get a tweet back from Virgin America saying that they're \\\"looking into this,\\\" which set everyone off again, \\\"Now she's gonna lose her job!\\\" I was just like, \\\"Oh now I've created a monster!\\\" Someone said to me, \\\"I work at Virgin Australia and I wouldn't even serve you tap water!\\\" I mean it's like... I'll have a Coke, actually.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWhy is it that they seat all the first class passengers before everyone in economy, instead of the first class people just staying in some lounge drinking champagne or something until economy is settled in?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIt's showing people that make no effort: this is what you could have if you tried harder! Lazy cheap cunts. All the first class passengers just have to sit there with the newspapers they give them . They're not reading them. They're just props so they don't have to look up at the economy passengers boarding. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EDon't miss Pam Ann's newest show \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://stage72.com/pam-ann-flight-72-the-worlds-fav-air-hostess-returns/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E\\\"Flight 72\\\"\\u003C/a\\u003E at the Triad Theater in New York City, June 1st through the 12th, and keep up to date with all things Pam Ann at \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.pamann.com\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Ewww.pamann.com\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/em\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T12:54:15-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-podell/an-interview-with-the-out_b_7498918.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-podell/an-interview-with-the-out_b_7498918.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 19:54:15 UTC +00:00], ["title", "An Interview With the Outrageous Pam Ann, International Air Hostess Comedienne"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:20:11 UTC +00:00]]

For context, I'm a 49-year-old father, with a 3-month-old and a 3-year-old. I'm writing about this for the other fathers out there who might relate. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSo, about my MAAN box. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI had a lot of \\\"stress\\\" or \\\"pressure\\\" last week, and for one reason or another, wasn't handling it functionally. Now I know dads who'd be drinking a lot at this point, glamorizing it, and totally in denial that they are really treating anxiety with alcohol. But fortunately, or maybe unfortunately, I'm past the days of thinking that experiencing anxiety makes me less of a man. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSo, I was stressed, and busy -- and anxious. I was a fully stocked steam engine, with no healthy release valve.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMost everything people said bothered me, such as, \\\"You must feel disappointed you didn't go to Egypt on that sweet consulting contract.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nReally? \\\"Must I?\\\" You fargin icehole. How dare you tell me how I feel? How about asking me how I feel? Ever think of that? You wingnut?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOr folks will say cheerly, \\\"Hi Caleb.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnd I would dearly want to give them a cold Clint Eastwood stare and lip snarl. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn this box, I loathe even more than usual, frequent and fake laughs, repetitive anything in speech such as, \\\"like,\\\" \\\"as I said,\\\" \\\"sort of,\\\" \\\"whatever,\\\" and \\\"it's all good.\\\" Oh, and people who say the same thing twice, or three times, in slightly different ways, and  people in general, and their friends, relatives and people they have met -- or seen online. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhat lead up to this?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nA LOT! Work ramped up suddenly, with a consulting contract and a conference, both intertwined. A trip was planned to Egypt with a week's notice, then canceled. But the contract got more intense in terms of work because it became virtual. This left me simultaneously holding down my job, a contract, and prepping a presentation.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI was way outside my flow zone for sure. What I was in really was more of a white knuckle ride.  But I was tough, wasn't I? Bring it on baby! I can handle it. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThen I came back home. As I entered my house I felt a bit like a mix of two stereotypical men you might recognize from movies and books. The first stereotype is the 1950s father who comes home from work and retreats to an easy chair, a drink, and silence. The other is the stereotypical rebel biker who hits the road for freedom, leaving everyone with nothing more then a middle finger and loud noise.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHere's a confabulation of the the rants these two stereotypes might go on as they are blasted by the needs of a young family. \\\"You infidels can't possibly understand the shitstorm I just came from at work, the pressure, diverse complexity, and outside my skillset things I'm trying to do at work... while also networking so I'm employable if I lose my job. They don't know how much I'm unsure it will all work! They worry about trivialities with no realization that their entire world is supported by my paycheck and I'm at a breaking point! Are they checking in with me? They are not. There's no time for that. And if they did, they wouldn't like Daddy Downer's answer now would they? And they couldn't possibly understand anyway, since they aren't working with me and don't, can't, understand my work, so, why even try to tell anyone how I feel?\\\" Where's my drink? Or my Harley, or maybe both with a hotel room on the beach with... Oh, and I don't actually have TIME to get all touchy feely, since I have two hours of work to do after dinner and putting the kids to bed. And now it's my turn to hold the baby since my wife is on the frickin' edge after a day with two cranky kids. So we've both had a hard day, but I'm treated like I'm fresh for battle when I walk in the door, when actually, I'm just returning, and I'm wounded! I'm shell-shocked. But I'm a soldier.  I bet if they felt like I did,  they couldn't handle it? They'd crumble under the pressure. They would. But I'll be fine. I won't crumble, hell, I won't even say anything. You know why? Because if I did, I'd say it wrong and end up in a screaming fight with my wife, instead of getting the support and understanding I really need. Oh, but I'll make it. I'm strong and tough and I get the job done. I won't complain or explain. Rat bastards. Ectoplasms! \\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThis particular mental and emotional box has some flavors of the \\\"Man Box\\\" a term coined by Tony Porter in his TED talk \\\"A Call To Men.\\\" But I am not experiencing the parts of Tony's Man Box that have to do with women, just my own emotions.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBeing a man can be confusing. Sometimes the bad is bundled with the good. It's hard to know which is which sometimes. I like a lot of \\\"man-ish\\\" things, things by the way which I think are not limited to men at all. I think they can be helpful to the right family with good man things.  I like being the one in my household who worries about the car engine, tire tread ware, and how thick our break pads are. I clean the really dirty drains and pipes, and keep them clean -- on the inside where the hair and gunk is. I think often about the condition of the inside of our furnace and I have a compulsion to grow lawn grass fast in an upward direction, that I then spend time cutting it back down, vs growing healthy vegetables we can eat, like my wife focuses on... silly wife! I often wonder if our computers need some optimizing and how much money we need to save for new windows in 2021. I'd rather make something with tools that is really hard and makes my body hurt and sweat then go to the gym and hurt and sweat. I am proud if get a little cut and work right through it with blood on my shovel, while I'm in the mud, in a ditch, in the freezing rain. I make sure my hands get really cold at the start of ever winter, so I don't need to wear gloves all the time. I'm pretty sure that if a big monster comes, I'm the one who will be killed slowing it down as my wife takes the kids out the back. I have hunting guns I wish I used more then once a decade. I've owned trucks. I have plans on how I'll kill small animals to eat during the zompoc.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut the bad parts of being a man I don't like. Macho bull. Stupidity camouflaged as daring. Control freaks dog beaters, those who mistreat women, and myself when I was young and feel pray to the band's Cake's warning, \\\"Excess ain't rebellion, you're drinking what they're selling.\\\" Somewhere I got into self-identifying as someone who is tough and doesn't express that I'm hurt. And I didn't get into expressing how I feel in non-violent communication ways that people respond to positively. So, a box. Shouldn't express, and if I do, I provoke. Also, with little practice, it can literally take me hours or days to even know how I actually feel past simple bottled up anger. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nA Man Box is a good way to talk about it in two words. The sides of this box I was in seemed made of marginalization, anger, anxiety, and neglect. Fear is on the top and bottom, held tightly down in my chest, over my heart. Fear of what? Not sure. Maybe not getting what I really need? Fear of expressing myself and having it work out well? Fear of letting go of the fear? I become quiet, focused on work, wanting to be alone, or with those who can understand what I'm experiencing because they are too. Dive bars become attractive ideas, so does escape, like eating lots of mac and cheese, with a bottle of wine, while watching two or three movies in a row. Or perhaps buying a sailboat. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI did get out of my box, through the top, through the fear. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHow? I expressed my feelings to my wife, gently, briefly. She is amazing at receiving my baggage, if I hand it to her without an attack she handles it with grace and compassion.  I also wrote this post over several days, and took a long walk, drank water, and watched a movie. Expressing  is good. The fear went on its miserable way, hopefully not to another man. A kind strength came into the place of fear in my chest. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIronically, I think it takes more strength for me open up then for me to be in my box. If I'm really toughened up, battle ready and with my sword sharpened, being the man I want to be, the good parts of being man, then I can express my feelings. The box becomes a thing used for shipping stuff, or making forts with the kids, not for being in. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T13:26:33-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/caleb-clark/being-in-a-maan-box-marginalization-anxiety-anger-and-neglect_b_7507312.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/caleb-clark/being-in-a-maan-box-marginalization-anxiety-anger-and-neglect_b_7507312.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:26:33 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Being in a MAAN Box (Marginalization, Anxiety, Anger and Neglect)"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:36:34 UTC +00:00]]

For many years, our two organizations have joined forces working on behalf of youth in the Middle East and North Africa. In Amman, Jordan, we recently co-hosted a conference, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://aye2015.org/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EArab Youth Employment: Promoting Innovative Solutions to Longstanding Challenges\\u003C/a\\u003E, which focused on the powerful role of partnerships in scaling up successful youth employment initiatives in the region.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"You don't have to choose between launching innovative or traditional business start-ups,\\\" one promising entrepreneur from Jordan recently argued. \\\"In our culture, we can do both at the same time.\\\" A young woman who just started her own social enterprise to improve the local environment responded: \\\"Yes, but whatever we do, young people must take action ourselves to address this region's huge social and economic challenges, and not wait for governments or anyone else to do this for us.\\\"  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThis exchange between two young social entrepreneurs was part of \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://aye2015.org/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Ea recent gathering in Amman, Jordan\\u003C/a\\u003E, that attracted nearly 500 business, government, civil society, and youth leaders from the Middle East and North Africa. At the top of the agenda: to build momentum around the urgent need to expand job and entrepreneurship opportunities across the region. Today, unemployment among young Arab men and women is the highest in the world. Even more alarming, this jobless rate continues to rise across the region--from 24 percent in 2009 to 29 percent in 2014--leaving millions more young people struggling to find a decent job, support their families, and lead a life with dignity.   \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.silatech.com/home\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ESilatech \\u003C/a\\u003Eand the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://iyfnet.org\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EInternational Youth Foundation\\u003C/a\\u003E have worked together for years in countries across the region, seeking new strategies and partners to reverse these shocking statistics. We share a deep commitment to ensure more Arab youth can reach their full potential and build their own futures and communities. For this reason, we co-sponsored the Amman conference to help identify and share programs and strategies that are already having a real and sustained impact on young people's lives. We also wanted to bring key actors together to mobilize resources to scale up these successful efforts--and plan next steps to move this critical agenda forward.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe fact is these unacceptably high rates of unemployment among Arab youth are due to many complex factors, including years of adverse economic conditions, misguided educational initiatives, and outdated systems. While some Arab countries have initiated successful solutions to the jobless crisis, including modernization of vocational education and investment funds designed to support youth programs, these steps, by and large, have been unable to address the much larger task of integrating Arab youth into the global job market economy. The status quo is simply not working, and the region's youth, and the rest of the world, continue to pay a terrible price. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhile much remains to be done to tackle this urgent challenge, the Amman meeting was a healthy reminder that progress is being made. Listening to spirited young people describe their entrepreneurial successes and passion to lead change underscored for us the extent to which this younger generation is already at work to rebuild their communities, creating much needed jobs, and looking with hope toward the future.    \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nImpressive strides are also being made on tough issues such as bridging the \\\"skills gap\\\"--where the needs of the jobs marketplace don't necessarily match the skills young people are learning in schools or in vocational training programs. Today, there is a growing consensus that for young people to be successful they need to acquire life skills just as much, if not more, than technical or professional skills. That's true of young women and men trying to start their own businesses as well as those seeking to join the workforce. Teaching skills like teamwork, problem-solving, risk taking, communications, and project management is gaining a real foothold here in the Middle East and North Africa. As a result, more young people--even those struggling to find employment with a college diploma--are finding greater success.   \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe recognize that real progress--on a regional or global scale--will require systems change and a \\\"new normal\\\" in the ways schools (from middle schools to universities), training programs, and the private sector prepare young people for the jobs of the 21st Century. It will require all of us to scale up effective and sustainable initiatives that will benefit not hundreds or thousands but millions of young people. It will mean building an environment that supports experience, modernization, and mutual learning.

But having said that, cars are made so much better today than they were a generation ago. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHere are three things to do before you purchase a used vehicle.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E1.  Have a certified mechanic inspect a used car before purchase \\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI was recently reminded of the dangers of used car buying when an unfortunate motorist broke down and had to pull into my driveway! Can you imagine the irony? I spend a lot of my days warning people not to buy used car lemons and here I have just such a drama playing out in front of my eyes. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn this particular instance, the motorist was a member of the U.S. Air Force who bought the used car from a Craigslist seller. The airman had just picked up the car and didn't even make it home before the vehicle broke down. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI bring this story up to show you that all used cars are sold \\\"as is,\\\" whether by a private seller or a licensed dealer -- unless they come with a written warranty. Worse yet, the seller is not required by law to be honest about the condition of the vehicle. Whatever representations they make about the car can be false. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOn my radio show, I talk to so many people who are duped when buying a used car. We call them \\\"razor blade calls\\\" because they're so painful to hear. There's usually nothing I can do to help them.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHere's my key rule of used car buying: Have the car inspected by a certified diagnostic mechanic of your choosing as a condition of purchase. You can leave a deposit if you wish, but specify in writing that the money must be returned to you if the car doesn't check out. You can eliminate nine out of 10 used car buying disasters this way.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYou want an ASE-certified (Automotive Service Excellence) mechanic. Garages that participate in the Blue Seal program typically feature the most highly trained ASE-certified mechanics. Visit ASE.com to find one near you.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E2. Vet out the problem cars online\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, I gave warnings about flood cars entering the used car market. At that time, hundreds of thousands of vehicles were rebuilt and had their titles \\\"washed.\\\" But this is really a recurring problem that happens anytime we have a major hurricane season or flooding. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nDishonest people take flooded vehicles into certain states where they can easily wash titles. That action removes any evidence that the vehicle was ever in a flood. Cars with washed titles can then be sold to any dealership across the country that either doesn't know or doesn't care that they're buying a flood vehicle. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThese cars often end up in the hands of \\\"curb stoners,\\\" which are illegal dealers who run ads in the paper. They pretend they're selling their sister's car or their mother's car and they hope you don't know what they know. About 20 percent of these cars go to unsuspecting people overseas. The other 80 stay right here at home. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nTo the naked eye, there's no telling that anything is amiss with these cars. But you'll know you've got a flood car when you encounter failed electrical systems throughout the vehicle.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nA lot of people will pay CarFax.com $35 to run the vehicle identification number (VIN) and check for any title problems, liens, odometer rollback, salvage history and more. That's a good idea. But I want you to be doubly sure and also run the VIN through a free database operated by the National Insurance Crime Bureau at \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.nicb.org/theft_and_fraud_awareness/vincheck/vincheck\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ENICB.org\\u003C/a\\u003E. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nEven if the car checks out in both databases, you still want to have the vehicle inspected by a diagnostic mechanic before you buy (as I explain above). If the used car you want checks out in CarFax and NICB and it passes a diagnostic inspection, you can be confident it is a good car. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E3. Check a Car's Repair Record Before Buying\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBuying a used car involves a little more risk than buying a new car because you never know how the previous owner treated that vehicle. One way to minimize that risk is to buy used car models that have proven to be reliable.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe best place to get that information is in \\u003Cem\\u003EConsumer Reports\\u003C/em\\u003E. The magazine publishes its Annual Auto Issue every April, containing a rundown of all its top picks for the new model year. But near the back of the April issue, you'll also find detailed information on used cars. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe Auto Issue lays out Consumer Reports' top used car picks by price category. There are also detailed reliability ratings for the past six model years on every possible nameplate, which are compiled from reports about 17 common trouble spots in more than a million cars on the road. This latter feature gives you a great vantage point on long-term reliability.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnother helpful feature is the magazine's list of \\\"Used Cars to Avoid\\\" and a companion tally called the \\\"Worst of the Worst\\\" list. You never want to buy one of the stinkers on these lists! \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIf you stick to \\u003Cem\\u003EConsumer Reports\\u003C/em\\u003E' list of recommended used vehicles, odds are good that you won't have any major problems. You shouldn't have to buy an extended warranty.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EVisit \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/index.htm\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EConsumerReports.org\\u003C/a\\u003E to purchase one-time access or read the April issue for free at your local library.\\u003C/em\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T13:21:55-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/clark-howard/3-steps-to-take-before-bu_b_7505580.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/clark-howard/3-steps-to-take-before-bu_b_7505580.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:21:55 UTC +00:00], ["title", "3 Steps To Take Before Buying a Used Car"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:36:34 UTC +00:00]]

And then the process begins anew.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAccording to the graffiti and street artists, the spray paint itself is unlikely to flake or chip, even when multiple layers have built up over time. But once the latex is rolled on, the spray paint binds to it, so when the latex cracks and peels as expected, the layers behind it come along for the ride.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-03-1433350994-3782341-seawall3.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-06-03-1433350994-3782341-seawall3.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-03-1433350994-3782341-seawall3-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"570\\\" height=\\\"320\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"It's going to get picked up on the food chain at the bottom, the plants and all the microorganisms. Once it gets in the food chain and it will be in the food chain forever,\\\" says a local veterinarian said during a recent ABC News report. One exacerbating factor is the existing presence of small plastic bits, including pellets often referred to as nurdles, which form the raw materials of many plastic products of all types worldwide. Nurdles are essentially toxic sponges, and exist in the oceans (and on beaches) in uncountable numbers thanks to shipping spills, accidental releases at factories and a variety of other hazards. Any toxins released by paint chips are likely to be absorbed by these nurdles, which, according to NOAA have already been found in small fish, plankton, shellfish and sea birds. And though the state of California has banned such plastics from commercial products, the damage has already been done. It's only a matter of time until toxic nurdles find their way into our seafood dinners.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhether such concerns will have an effect on the Bolinas seawalls remains to be seen. Historically the Bolinas community has encouraged all forms of artistic expression, and is one of the few places where street and graffiti artists have been welcome to paint on public structures, including the seawalls.  Some of the murals and other public art installations have been part of the Bolinas townscape for over 30 years. As one local surfer put it,  \\\"Bolinas is getting overrun by the Mill Valley people who don't like the edgy side of town.\\\" Yet even though Mill Valley, Sausalito and other uber-expensive Marin towns are only 40 minutes away, Bolinas remains a world of its own. When the marine layer of fog and low clouds settles in for the summer, weeks may pass without sunshine, making the colorful seaside murals a welcome respite from endless days of gray.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOf course Bolinas isn't the only town with painted seawalls. The Galveston Seawall, which depicts sea life painted by schoolchildren, is a Texas tourist attraction. Since it has never been buffed or painted over with latex, there is little concern for its effect on the coastal environment. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe Surfrider Foundation, an international organization dedicated to protecting public beaches, has successfully prevented the building of new seawalls on many beaches, preferring instead to support the re-location buildings that are threatened by erosion, leaving the ocean and it's beaches to the forces of nature. (An inquiry regarding the Bolinas controversy directed to the chairman of the local chapter of the Surfrider Foundation was not returned.) It is highly unlikely that the many houses that dot the cliffs of Bolinas will be relocated any time soon, paint chips notwithstanding.   \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"Trying to crack down on the artists will only make buffing more acceptable, which will only result in more paint chips,\\\" said the local surfer. Graffiti is also ensconced in the social culture of surfers and skateboarders alike, who are apt to point out that paint chips are a minuscule nuisance when compared with the abuse regularly ladled into the ocean by oil companies and other industries. As for beachgoers who claim to love art \\\"but don't wish to see it when they go to the beach,\\\" seawall-free Stinson Beach is right across the narrow shark-infested channel to Bolinas Lagoon. \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-03-1433351462-5085330-smallbutterfly.png\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-06-03-1433351462-5085330-smallbutterfly.png\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-03-1433351462-5085330-smallbutterfly-thumb.png\\\" width=\\\"108\\\" height=\\\"82\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T13:11:04-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeb-harrison/when-art-becomes-poison_b_7504244.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeb-harrison/when-art-becomes-poison_b_7504244.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:11:04 UTC +00:00], ["title", "When Art Becomes Poison"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:36:34 UTC +00:00]]

Rick Perry vetoed Texas's version of the Lilly Ledbetter bill, which would have helped protect women in Texas from pay discrimination. He called the debate over equal pay \\\"nonsense.\\\" Tell that to Texas women who make 79 cents on the dollar compared to their male counterparts.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nPerry's anti-woman agenda didn't stop there. Thanks to his anti-choice policies like defunding Planned Parenthood and other family planning programs, half of the women in Texas face difficult barriers to exercising their right to choose and make their own health care decisions. Currently, Texas is fifth highest in teenage pregnancy, lagging behind the rest of the country.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nCare about health insurance? The Texas business community agrees that expanding Medicaid - the federal government's health insurance plan for the less fortunate that was signed into law by Texas's own President Lyndon Johnson -- is a smart business decision. Texas's economy would be strengthened with thousands of new jobs and billions in federal funds for our health system. Nonetheless, Perry refused to partner with the Texas legislature to find a Texas solution, despite the state having the highest uninsured rate in the country.  When asked about that high uninsured rate and Medicaid expansion, Perry claimed \\\"that's what Texans wanted.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nCare about education? Perry cut Texas' neighborhood school funding by 25 percent, and his decision to deregulate tuition rates for Texas state universities sent tuition soaring by 64 percent.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nCare about wages? As president, Perry would refuse to raise the minimum wage, and doesn't even believe in the minimum wage at the federal level. This is all while Texas leads the nation in minimum-wage workers, and at the end of Perry's term, 1.5 million more Texans were living in poverty.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nTo top it off, Perry embarrassed our state with his cringe-worthy, bigoted rhetoric and out-of-touch social views. \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rick-perry-stepped-right-in-it-comparing-gays-to-alcoholics/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EHe compared gay people to alcoholics\\u003C/a\\u003E. He has made false immigration claims to drum up fear and panic with no facts to back it up. While governor, he made multiple bizarre claims about Texas seceding from the nation. And no one can forget the time he forgot which federal agencies he wanted to cut, embarrassing himself and the state of Texas on a national stage, and making it clear how seriously he took his candidacy. 'Oops' was right, and we'd be fools to think he's changed.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAfter spending his time in office creating two different states in Texas -- one for the mega-rich and another for everyone else -- voters are rightly skeptical of someone like Rick Perry in the White House.

For your face, however, you should start off with a quarter-sized amount. For your body, go for a larger amount comparable to a gold-dollar coin, for example. The amount of sunblock equal to a gold-dollar coin size should adequately cover your legs, and then this same amount should also be applied to the upper body and back. Always make sure that you fully cover all areas on your body and if you feel as if you should be adding more, always add more.

Fitzgerald said, \\\"Your loan may be sold to a debt buyer. In fact, it may be sold several times. Your chances of success (defined as paying less than 100%) increases dramatically.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut consumers who were sued by National Collegiate over student loan debt and who have demanded to see the proof they own the debt have won in Ohio, Florida,and Kentucky. And cases in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania have proved to be trouble for National Collegiate Student Loan Trust, as well. In California there is a pending class-action lawsuit against National Collegiate over these same issues.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nGreg Reichenbach, who contacted me, was quoted in the Bloomberg article. \\\"The suits didn't assert that National Collegiate owned the loans, and after Beverly appealed, National Collegiate was unable to produce any documents indicating it owned them. \\\"The whole basis for the lawsuit is that they are entitled to enforce this alleged debt, and they don't even claim that they were assigned the debt, let alone prove it,\\\" says Reichenbach, who handled Beverly's appeal.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut asking for proof the debt buyer has the authority to collect on a debt is not a luxury, it is your right.

With trailblazers like Janine Ellis, Sarina Russo and Ita Buttrose already lighting a path for women in the Australian business landscape, I strongly believed I could define my own spotlight and be successful.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHowever what is \\\"success?\\\" Too often money, fame and power are touted as the pillars of success. And if we don't achieve this golden trifecta, we can become consumed with envy of those who do. This is a concept which has been drilled into us subconsciously from a young age by childhood reward systems, like trophies and ribbons, and what is perceived as success in popular culture. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBeing narrowly guided by this prism can leave many entrepreneurs feeling hopeless and lost, disengaged and left thinking \\\"what's the point?\\\" before giving up and returning to the corporate grind.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn reality, we need to understand that entrepreneurship and success are whatever you want them to be.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ESuccess is... \\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHow we perceive success is pivotal for our happiness, and how we approach every day. In my experience, there is a lot of attachment on what others deem to be the pillars of success rather than actually achieving what they want.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe all have different definitions of entrepreneurship and we all have different definitions of success. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI believe it is essential there are a number of different perceptions, because if you can see success as achievable, you can actually go ahead and achieve it.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSuccess to some people might mean having that CEO position or getting paid a million dollars, while others define success as sitting in their study and just working as many hours as they want before going to their yoga class.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFor me, success isn't about how much money you make, how loud you are or how much power you hold. Success is about inspiring others and the difference I can make in other people's lives. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EOwn your success\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOwning my role as an inspiring and successful entrepreneur wasn't easy. So much of me resisted this idea of stepping into the spotlight until I had a revelation. It wasn't about me at all. It was about the people who I could share my knowledge with and how it could change their lives.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMany entrepreneurs, particularly women, find it challenging to own the spotlight. There are many blocks, whether it's like me with introversion, not believing you are good enough or afraid of what others may think.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThis is because there is a lot of attachment to the word entrepreneurship and what it means to succeed. When the media and my peers started to referring me as an inspiring entrepreneur, I recall thinking, \\\"Oh but I am not Arianna Huffington or Richard Branson, therefore I am not an entrepreneur.\\\" \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHowever, I am an entrepreneur because I am a risk taker, I think up new ideas, I follow through with them, I try them even if they don't work, then I move onto the next thing.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nLikewise, I am successful because I run a thriving business, I have helped thousands of people to become highly paid and sought after experts and thought leaders and I have made a difference in people's lives and their businesses.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nChanging my perception of what I perceived success to be gave me a new drive and a better understanding of my business and what I wanted to achieve.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nEntrepreneurs need to put success into their own context. Rather than listening to popular culture, shift your perspective to what is important to you. Not only does this help map out a vision for your business, but it helps overcome any limits which you believe have been imposed. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EAbout the author\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nCatriona Pollard is the author of 'From Unknown To Expert', a step by step framework designed to help entrepreneurs develop effective PR and social media strategies to become recognised as thought leaders and influencers in their field. \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.unknowntoexpert.com/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Ewww.UnknownToExpert.com\\u003C/a\\u003E. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nCatriona is also the director of CP Communications, which merges traditional PR tactics with cutting-edge social media strategies that engage consumers as well as business.  \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.cpcommunications.com.au/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Ewww.cpcommunications.com.au\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.unknowntoexpert.com/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Ewww.UnknownToExpert.com\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.cpcommunications.com.au/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Ewww.cpcommunications.com.au   \\u003C/a\\u003E \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://twitter.com/#!/catrionapollard\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E@catrionapollard\\u003C/a\\u003E  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.facebook.com/catrionapollard\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Ewww.facebook.com/catrionapollard\\u003C/a\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T13:39:40-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/catriona-pollard/perspective-is-everything_1_b_7489604.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/catriona-pollard/perspective-is-everything_1_b_7489604.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:39:40 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Perspective Is Everything: Why Entrepreneurs Need to Re-Evaluate Success"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:52:30 UTC +00:00]]

To a keeper of my most intimate and precious secrets.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EBut I heard it.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAgain and again and again and I think he's probably called me Kim around 78 times.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe thought of correcting him, now, and damaging this thing we have, makes me feel icky. Makes me feel like it's too late. Makes me think maybe it's easier to march down to the courthouse and legally change my name to Kim, rather than set him straight.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThat's crazy, I know, but it seems a whole lot easier than telling someone you've known for two years that they don't know your name.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYesterday, someone on a work conference call called me Jessica.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI didn't know they were talking to me at first, but then I realized the question that was asked was directed to me, and only me.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSo I answered -- and quickly. For the next two hours, I became Jessica.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSure, I should have put an end to this immediately. The first time I realized I was Kim or Jessica, I should have pressed the pause button on the whole thing. I should have interrupted the conversation about the weather or the meeting agenda and said, \\\"That's not my name!\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut I was flustered. I was still processing the whole thing.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI guess I still am.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMaybe it's too late. Maybe I'll forever be Jen to some and Kim or Jessica to others.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nDoes it matter? I don't know.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI'll figure it out, I'm sure. One day, when it's the right moment, my cheeks will turn blood red and i'll say, \\\"I need to tell you something, OK?\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut until then, I'll answer to three very different names. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T13:39:25-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jen-glantz/what-to-do-when-someone-calls-you-the-wrong-name_b_7511602.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jen-glantz/what-to-do-when-someone-calls-you-the-wrong-name_b_7511602.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:39:25 UTC +00:00], ["title", "What to Do When Someone Calls You the Wrong Name"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:52:30 UTC +00:00]]

My position: more guns equals fewer crimes.  And even more to the point, I said on national television that we should arm our school teachers and administrators to give them a fighting chance in the event of a school attack like what happened at Sandy Hook Elementary.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhat followed that TV interview was shocking: I was lambasted with hate mail and death threats.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut now, Actor Vince Vaughn \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/entertainment/articles/2015-05/29/vince-vaughn-covers-july-issue-british-gq\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Etells \\u003Cem\\u003EGQ Magazine\\u003C/em\\u003E \\u003C/a\\u003Ethat Americans should have guns in public, and furthermore, guns should be allowed in schools.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nVaughn \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/entertainment/articles/2015-05/29/vince-vaughn-covers-july-issue-british-gq\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Esays\\u003C/a\\u003E, \\\"In all of our schools it is illegal to have guns on campus, so again and again these guys go and shoot up these schools because they know there are no guns there.

How many more innocent children need to die before we wake up and prepare our teachers to fight back? The only solution is self-responsibility: arm school officials and give them a fighting chance. No gunman is going to target a school that can defend itself and fight back.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nJudge Napolitano \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://insider.foxnews.com/2015/06/02/judge-nap-vince-vaughn-has-good-point-guns-schools\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Ealso told\\u003C/a\\u003E Stuart Varney that innocent kids are like \\\"fish in a barrel to a monster.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nUnfortunately, Napolitano is right. If you take the emotion out of it and look at the situation through logic, the only practical solution is to arm the teachers. Let's be real for a minute: In a perfect world we wouldn't need to take these kinds of measures. But we're talking about the safety and well-being of our precious children.  Shouldn't we at least give them a fighting chance? If a crazed gunman walked into your child's school, wouldn't you feel a little better knowing your child's teacher and school administrator had a chance to protect your child?  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYou may recall in the tragedy at Sandy Hook, first-grade teacher and hero Victoria Soto was shot and killed after hiding her kids in a closet and telling the gunman the kids were in gym.  She might still be alive today had she been armed and able to defend herself. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nA lot of people say guns are scary and have no place on a school campus with young children.  The problem with that argument is it detracts from the real issue at hand and it's clouded with emotion: Like it or not, the bad guys are always going to have guns.  There's nothing we can do to stop that.  So if that's the case, then we have two choices: sit around and let them overpower us or fight back.  I don't know about you, but I'd rather fight back.  And if a crazed gunman goes to my child's school, I want my child's teacher and school staff to fight back, too.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nRight now, the only solution is to exercise our second amendment rights, arm our teachers and school officials and keep a close eye on anti-gun crusaders who want to make our decisions for us. A school should be a safe haven where children can learn and grow. Arming teachers is the only practical solution to keep our children safe. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T13:35:59-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-siebold/actor-vince-vaughn-and-judge_b_7502190.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-siebold/actor-vince-vaughn-and-judge_b_7502190.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:35:59 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Actor Vince Vaughn and Judge Andrew Napolitano Agree: Arm Our School Teachers with Guns"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:52:30 UTC +00:00]]

Gallup has been asking folks since 1992 how they feel about how much \\\"upper-income people\\\" pay in taxes, and 18 times in a row a solid majority has said the rich pay too little. For the past four years, either 61 or 62 percent have said the wealthy don't pay enough; it's hard to figure why Iowans would conclude that Sanders is \\\"unelectable\\\" because he takes the same position on tax hikes for the wealthy as three out of every five Americans. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n[...]\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nCutting the military budget isn't as popular as taxing the rich, but it's by no means unpopular. It's not a question pollsters often ask about--almost as if levels of military spending aren't seen as a fit subject for public debate--but in 2013 Pew asked which was more important, \\\"taking steps to reduce the budget deficit or keeping military spending at current levels.\\\" Fifty-one percent said reducing the deficit; only 40 percent chose maintaining the military budget.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn February 2014, the last time Gallup polled on whether spending \\\"for national defense and military purposes\\\" was \\\"too little, about the right amount, or too much,\\\" a plurality of 37 percent picked \\\"too much.\\\" Only 28 percent said \\\"too little\\\"-but again, you're never going to see the \\u003Cem\\u003ENew York Times\\u003C/em\\u003E declare a candidate to be \\\"unelectable\\\" for proposing to raise the Pentagon's budget.\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe polling data cited by FAIR suggests that there's no obvious reason to believe that a candidate who advocates raising taxes on the wealthy and cutting the Pentagon budget should be \\\"unelectable,\\\" unless some group of people besides voters determines who is \\\"electable.\\\"  (Indeed, President Obama not only advocated raising taxes on the wealthy, but actually did so, with the grudging agreement of Congressional Republicans. President Obama hasn't cut the Pentagon budget in real terms, but he did cut its previously projected growth path. The Republican Congress largely acquiesced to this \\\"cut\\\" by passing the Budget Control Act and leaving it in place - although they are currently trying to get around the budget caps for the Pentagon by padding the uncapped OCO \\\"war budget\\\" with Pentagon spending.) \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut the \\u003Cem\\u003ETimes\\u003C/em\\u003E made a somewhat different claim: that Sanders advocated \\\"far higher\\\" taxes on the wealthy and \\\"deep\\\" cuts to Pentagon spending. How much higher? How deep?

However, I  cannot recall a time when I regretted making a choice that I felt was right. But  what I have regretted are the times that I failed to fully consider the  implications of my choices on my family, whether my team was ready to change,  and how the stereotypes related to my race, age and gender would play into  people's response.  \\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOne  strategy I have developed for myself and my clients to help us be prepared for  the possible implications of a major decision and weigh their pro's and con's is  \\\"Considering the FACTS.\\\" The FACTS represent Family, Agency, Community, Truth,  and Society.

As a result, change leads to  internal conflict as the organization and its employees are stretched and  challenged to operate outside of their comfort zones.

All leaders must also  consider how their choices represent the community with which they are  personally, professionally and politically affiliated as well as how that  community will respond.  African-American  woman may feel the need to temper her responses so as not to evoke the image of  the \\\"angry black woman\\\" and display her relatability  to other people of color  with whom they work despite the vast differences in personalities, histories,  and approaches.

However, if you are going to be a rare and  courageous leader, only the last two will determine what decision you  make.  That is why I'm in awe of Marilyn  Mosby's leadership at the age of 35. She considered the impact of her decision  on her family, office and community and made the choice she felt best aligned  with her personal truth and what is best for society.

The trio of mutts, ages 2 to 9, left an outdoor Thai facility where dogs are crammed together in filthy cages and 40 hours later, glimpsed freedom in Southern California.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn their new home, Gigi and Mimi cautiously emerged from an airplane crate and glanced around, while the male pooch, Singha, bounded out. He padded across a rug, a sensation he had never felt, and then took a big whiff of the earth outside.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"It's like he was saying: 'Like, wow, I'm home.' I let them have some freedom, go to the bathroom and get fresh air,\\\" said Garvin, who lives in Agoura Hills, about 35 miles northwest of Los Angeles.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nLIFE Animal Rescue in the California city has placed 50 Thai dogs in the last two years, including Garvin's, said founder Emily Bernie. She partnered with Cindy Amey, who lived in Thailand for five years and set up a network of rescues, veterinarians and shippers.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThey aren't the only ones working to save dogs bound for a serving dish, even though the taste for dog meat is fading overseas. In March, Humane Society International and the Change for Animals Foundation teamed up to bring nearly 60 dogs from a South Korean meat farm to Northern California to be adopted. The farmer agreed to close the business and raise produce instead. In January, more than 20 dogs were saved from a Seoul dog meat farm and sent to Washington, D.C., to start new lives.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn adopting a dog that hasn't had the advantages many Western dogs enjoy — toys, treats and attention — Garvin didn't know what to expect. She wondered about simple things, such as how they would act in her backyard.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"I didn't know if I should let them have that much space immediately,\\\" she said. But \\\"they came out extremely relaxed and appreciative. It was a joy to watch.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSix weeks after their arrival, Gigi and Mimi are getting more comfortable but stick close to Garvin's side, while Sangha is still awe-struck.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"He was really impressed with the grass and likes to smell the dirt and cement,\\\" she said.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThai dogs are rescued from often appalling conditions, says Amey, who has moved to Australia and helps save animals through her group, K9Aid International.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMeat merchants round up abandoned or stray dogs, pack them together in tiny cages and stack them on trucks to be sold as food. Other dogs taken off the street are sent to deplorable-looking shelters, where several are squeezed into filthy cages and given little food and no medical care, Amey said. Dogs die of disease or fights in the massive outdoor enclaves, where adoptions are rare and euthanasia nonexistent, she said.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBernie's group in California faces criticism for rescuing dogs abroad when there are animals at home that need help.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe 24-year-old LIFE Animal Rescue has placed over 6,000 dogs locally, but shelter conditions in the U.S. have changed drastically in the last quarter-century, she said. Many have moved away from euthanasia.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"The dogs do not know borders,\\\" Bernie said. \\\"If the dogs need help, I don't care where they are located.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe efforts have meant a happy ending for Garvin and her three adopted pooches.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe pets have gotten used to the daily schedule at their new home: two meals, three walks, playtime, watching TV upstairs and then bedtime.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"It's amazing how they have adapted,\\\" Garvin said.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/HuffPostGoodNews\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg src=\\\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/FBLOGO_0.png\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E \\u003Ca  href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/HuffPostGoodNews\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ELike Us On Facebook\\u003C/a\\u003E  \\u003Cbr class=\\\"ethanmobile\\\" /\\u003E \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/goodnews\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg src=\\\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/TWITTERBIRD.png\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/goodnews\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EFollow Us On Twitter\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T13:32:38-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/04/thailand-rescued-dogs_n_7513770.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/04/thailand-rescued-dogs_n_7513770.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:32:38 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Caged Dogs Rescued From Thailand Find Happy Homes In The U.S."], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:52:30 UTC +00:00]]

Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) and Patrick Meehan (R-Pa.), already has more than 20 co-sponsors from both parties.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIt's similar in many ways to the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/26/campus-sexual-assault-bill_n_6761170.html\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ECampus Accountability and Safety Act\\u003C/a\\u003E that's been introduced in the Senate. Both bills would require campus climate surveys, require the disclosure of investigations and findings, and increase penalties for violations of federal laws pertaining to sexual violence at colleges. Clery fines, for example, would increase from $35,000 to $100,000 per violation. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"When we finally have a real cost, we'll actually see schools take the issue seriously,\\\" said Laura Dunn, attorney advocate and founder of SurvJustice.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSeveral higher education organizations declined to comment on the bill Thursday. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nNotably, the HALT Campus Sexual Violence Act will for the first time create a private right of action under the Clery Act. Clery requires colleges to accurately track and disclose the number of crimes reported on campus, and thanks to amendments made as part of the Campus SaVE Act in 2013, it also lays out several new rights for the accused and accusers in sexual assault cases.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe Education Department has repeatedly said it's understaffed, and allowing litigation under Clery could reduce that strain since grievances could be moved from federal complaints under the department to the courts, Dunn noted. The new House bill would also dole out $5 million in extra funding for investigators in the department. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nCurrently, the Education Department's Office of Federal Student Aid has jurisdiction to investigate a college for Clery violations. But the department declines to name or even acknowledge when a school is under investigation. Instead, the public is left in the dark until a fine is announced, if one is imposed at all.

Dillon also complained that neither \\\"due process\\\" nor the word \\\"fair\\\" appear in the legislation or fact sheets distributed Thursday. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"It's entirely one-sided and only going to make things more unfair for the accused and give universities more reason to steamroll the accused,\\\" Dillon said.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nUnlike the Senate version of the bill, the HALT Campus Sexual Violence Act would not require colleges to disclose disciplinary outcomes or to have agreements with local law enforcement on how they will respond to situations. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnother difference between the two bills is that the campus climate surveys mandated under the House version would require schools to ask self-identified lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students about discrimination, assault and harassment related to their gender identity and sexual orientation. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T13:28:48-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/04/colleges-sued-rape-cases_n_7511484.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/04/colleges-sued-rape-cases_n_7511484.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:28:48 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Congressional Bill Would Open New Route For Colleges To Get Sued Over Rape Cases"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:52:30 UTC +00:00]]

A gentleman approaches me, points and states \\\" Seat C, that's mine!\\\" I simply pull out my boarding pass hold it up to him and he embarrassingly mumbles and files into his seat, His seat is D. Perhaps this was a genuine mistake on his part or perhaps his bravado showed up as bullying. Hard to know, but here's what matters.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIt took less than 30 seconds to formulate an opinion. Of course I imagine him in a sandbox as a child and decide little has changed.

First impressions run the risk of being lasting impressions. Your currency is based upon your ability to create leadership brand loyalty. This translates into your ability to attract 3 critical stakeholder groups.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMake sure those senior to you do not equate your leadership with \\\"managing up and kicking down\\\". If you lead this way they will be on to you.

This is no easy task. Back to that sandbox. Ask yourself if you protect and covet your turf or if you understand that your efforts and contribution are interdependent on your peers. Finding common ground requires humility. Humility to be wrong, humility to not have all the answers, and humility to give up something for the greater good.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAre you available and accessible to your team?

One is recognition for great work and the other is ensuring there are opportunities for your directs to obtain profile. You must be able to stretch and develop your team. Fostering aspirational leadership is one of your key responsibilities.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nCreating leadership brand loyalty is dependent upon your ability to attract invested stakeholders.

I recognize this, and I'm glad we have police. I feel much safer knowing that they are there.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHowever, as we have seen in the many protests across the country in response to police shootings of unarmed black men, women, and boys, many people of color do not feel safe around police. They do not feel protected, they feel afraid, harassed, mistreated, in danger.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe rally cry has become \\\"Black Lives Matter\\\" and in response, some have felt compelled to reply \\\"All Lives Matter.\\\" The issue, however, is not that anyone is proposing that other people's lives \\u003Cem\\u003Edo not\\u003C/em\\u003E matter. Of course everyone's lives matter -- including the lives of police officers. The \\u003Cem\\u003EBlack Lives Matter\\u003C/em\\u003E slogan draws attention to the fact that, in our country, people of color -- and in particular black males -- are systematically treated as if their lives did not matter.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAs Christians we should recognize the language of \\u003Cem\\u003Eblack lives matter\\u003C/em\\u003E. After all, Jesus did not say \\\"blessed is everyone,\\\" but \\\"blessed are the poor\\\" (Luke 6:20). He did not say \\\"as you do it unto everyone, you do it unto me,\\\" but \\\"as you do it unto the least\\\" (Matthew 25:40). Jesus did not say \\\"love everyone,\\\" but \\\"love your enemies\\\" (Matthew 5:44). \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nContinually Jesus drew our attention not to loving people \\\"in general\\\" but to specifically caring for those we would tend to discount or condemn. \\u003Cem\\u003EBlack lives matter\\u003C/em\\u003E is exactly the kind of thing Jesus would say. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhy did Jesus have this emphasis, and why should we? Because then as now, there are people who were marginalized, condemned, and shut out of the system, and the hallmark of Jesus' mission and ministry is all about drawing our attention to them. It has to do with empathy for the \\\"other,\\\" for the one we would normally regard the \\\"least.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThis is not an issue peripheral to the gospel, or a matter of a few isolated proof texts. It is at the  very heart of Jesus' ministry and mission. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThat's why it's so important that those of us who are part of the privileged class learn to listen to\\u003Cem\\u003E and to believe\\u003C/em\\u003E those in our society who are typically denied a voice when they tell us about their experiences of mistreatment. We need to hear when they tell us \\\"I can't breathe,\\\" both metaphorically and, all too often, literally.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nNoting that the cause of death in crucifixion is asphyxiation, Serene Jones, President of Union Theological Seminary, drives this point home for us poignantly when she states, \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003E  \\\"I can't breathe\\\" could very well have been uttered by Jesus on the cross--Jesus Christ, an oppressed minority under the most powerful government on the planet who was legally put to death by the state. But at least Jesus had a trial.\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThat puts a new light on Christ's words, \\\"As you do it unto the least of these, my brothers, you do it unto me.\\\" The way we treat people of color in our country is how we treat Jesus, who was himself a person of color. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nLooking at how Jesus told us to care for the poor, the least, and indeed how he told us to \\\"love our enemies,\\\" I am quite certain that he would also emphatically declare \\u003Cem\\u003Eblack lives matter\\u003C/em\\u003E. If we purport to be Christ's followers, just as we can say \\\"blessed are the poor\\\" even if we are not poor, we should likewise be able to say \\\"black lives matter\\\" even if we are not black. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThey matter, according the Jesus, because these are the very ones who are treated as the \\\"least\\\" in our country. They are the ones who are systematically criminalized, otherized, and marginalized. If we care about what Jesus cared about, then we need to care about this. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T13:55:53-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/derek-flood/why-jesus-would-say-black-lives-matter_b_7507098.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/derek-flood/why-jesus-would-say-black-lives-matter_b_7507098.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:55:53 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Why Jesus Would Say 'Black Lives Matter'"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 21:15:42 UTC +00:00]]

There are still vestiges of an ethic of men not beating up on a woman, even though they do it all the time; it's simply called \\\"domestic\\\" not public abuse. There's something about watching a woman going after a woman. \\\"Let's watch a cat fight,\\\" people say. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nQuite frankly, there has always been something to be gained in a male-dominated world by keeping women divided against women.  Old/young; married/single; lesbian/straight; fat/thin; pretty/ugly; working/non-working--whatever that means; all women work. Women candidates, such as Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina, for example, will present a sharp contrast in policy, principles and personal leadership style, but we need to be watchful that they are not pitted against one another \\\"to see women fight.\\\" \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWomen taking their full place in public life is an unfinished revolution. We have celebrated women's accomplishments. And yet, as with any great social change, remnants of longing for the past linger. Fear of loss of male power and domination remain in some quarters. One sees and hears it, in blatant statements or small, off-hand remarks.  Recently while traveling, my husband and I stopped at a convenience store. At the counter a stranger remarked to us about his wife standing beside him, \\\"She always gets what she wants.\\\"  Why did he feel he needed to say that to us? There's something there, unfinished, for him, and for thousands of other men, who cannot rejoice, even years after the modern feminist movement began.  It's reminiscent of a question we early feminists often heard, \\\"What else do they want?\\\" \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe issue is still about power -- and elusive partnership. Another man said to me last week in speaking about Hillary Clinton, \\\"How old is she? She probably won't have the energy to serve a full term.\\\"  Not enough power!  While others have long said Hillary has too much power.  There's always something wrong with a \\\"public woman.\\\" Too weak.  Too strong.  Too quiet.  Too loud.  Too . . .  I even heard a committee interviewing a candidate for a leadership position say that she was \\\"Too happy.\\\"  To find something wrong with every woman indicates a continuing deep reluctance to trust women in leadership for fear they will change everything and usurp power from men. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOf all the women with whom I have worked in the past five decades, willing and able to serve as leaders in the public sphere, not a one of them has had as her goal taking away power from men.  Each of them has wanted and worked towards the full partnership of women and men. And we have achieved amazing new models of women and men working together as true partners in so many fields.  The feminist revolution has been a revolution for men, too.  The transformation of society has meant a transformation of power itself.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnd yet. . .   And yet, systemic sexism remains.  The barriers may be different today than in the 1950's and 1960's, sometimes more subtle, sometime just differently blatant.  How important for women and men to recognize them.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn regard to the resurgence of racism, we say, \\\"We need to start a conversation.\\\"  Not only a conversation, but a listening to the deep fears that remain, and a determination to eradicate racial violence.  During this presidential election campaign we will see a re-emergence of systemic sexism, sexism that may have only gone partially underground. (I totally dislike the term, \\\"being politically correct,\\\" a sure sign that someone has not been transformed, but only feels they must pretend to be.) Rape continues.  Sexual discrimination continues. Fear of women fully using their gifts continues.  We have work to do.  Together. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T13:54:52-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/norma-cook-everist/many-men-still-fear-women-with-public-power_b_7501930.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/norma-cook-everist/many-men-still-fear-women-with-public-power_b_7501930.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:54:52 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Many Men Still Fear Women With Public Power"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 21:15:42 UTC +00:00]]

While having something to say might seem like a given for a writer, it's a given that's sometimes bypassed, especially by those who are more in love with the \\u003Cem\\u003Eidea\\u003C/em\\u003E of being a writer and being published than actually writing.  And, frankly, it's easy for even the geekiest of us writing geeks to get swept up by latest \\\"five secrets to writing a bestseller\\\" article on our Facebook feed and forget that the best articles and writing guidebooks in the world won't help us if we don't have something to say.  Or if we aren't loyal to what we have to say.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI see this sometimes in academia: Scholars who stop writing because they find they don't have that much to say about their field or they didn't have that much to say to begin with.  At institutions where a lot of emphasis for promotion -- for better or for worse -- is placed on publication, this leads to a great deal of frustration.  The good news is it's not hard to re-discover what you want to say; you just have to do some digging.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI also see it in writers who get blocked, who hit a writing wall, especially young writers, because they're second guessing themselves, or not being loyal to what they want to say.  They're not writing that memoir they've been wanting to write because they've heard memoir is passé unless you're a celebrity, or they've shelved that post-apocalyptic novel because they've heard no one is buying post-apocalyptic novels any more.  They're stuck; they're not writing because, paralyzed by the whims of the market, they don't know what to write. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFirst, guessing trends or even thinking about the market at this point can be a dangerous move.  For practical reasons, if zombie novels start to trend and you jump on the bandwagon, by the time, you finish your book and pitch it to agents, the market will be saturated with them. Too late for you.  You really have to write what you need to write about, say what you need to say, and let the chips fall where they will.  Over time you will accumulate a body of work, some of which you will publish regardless of industry trends, because it's writing that came from your heart, from what you needed to say.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nCase in point: My friend, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.robinzbecker.com\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ERobin Becker\\u003C/a\\u003E, wrote a fantastic zombie novel, \\u003Cem\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/brains-robin-becker/1103372771?ean=9780061974052\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EBrains\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/em\\u003E, because that was the novel she felt called to write at the time.  She wasn't thinking about the market.  But after she finished and polished it and added it to her considerable body of work, guess what had just started to trend?  The rest is history. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThomas Mann famously said, \\\"A writer is someone for whom writing is harder than it is for most people.\\\"  For the most part, I think this is true, or at least it's true when we're laboring to get the words just right, to make something from nothing.  Imagine how hard it is when our hearts are not in it.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe good news is your heart probably is in it, 100 percent. You probably have a lot to say.  You just have to give yourself permission to say it.  No words written are ever lost. Even if you end up putting those first few novels in a drawer, they will serve, even accelerate, your growth as a writer. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut most importantly, giving yourself permission to write what you need to write will, eventually, lead you to the next thing you need to write.  Maybe not right away -- sometimes after you finish a big project you need to let the well fill up -- but soon enough. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThat's how it works.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOne more case in point. My son is a beginning cellist with aspirations to make it a career.  He recently met with another cellist in the region, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.arkansasarts.org/programs/arts_on_tour/detail.aspx?id=276\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EStephen Feldman\\u003C/a\\u003E, -- who has since become his teacher -- for advice on how to begin this long path.  One of the things Dr. Feldman stressed was that my son needed to be pursuing music for the love of doing it, for the love of expressing himself through this instrument -- not for the money, or for the accolades, or the visions of glory because none of those things -- even if he was one of the lucky few who were fortunate to attain them -- would ultimately sustain him for the long haul. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAs I sat and listened, I knew I had brought my son to the right person. It was the same advice I would give an aspiring writer.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSome of what you write may see publication. Some of it won't.  But you can't think of that when you're doing it, when you're getting it down, when it's just you and the instrument.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut you must have something to say. And you must give yourself permission to say it. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T13:53:18-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephanie-vanderslice/the-geeks-guide-to-the-writing-life-having-something-to-say-and-saying-it_b_7504480.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephanie-vanderslice/the-geeks-guide-to-the-writing-life-having-something-to-say-and-saying-it_b_7504480.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:53:18 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The Geek's Guide to the Writing Life: Having Something to Say and Saying It"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 21:15:42 UTC +00:00]]

The nonprofit think tank used an online panel to interview 225 dual-income gay and straight couples this past spring and found some interesting differences: \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch1\\u003E1.

Men, not surprisingly, did the traditionally male chores like outdoor work and household repairs.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nGay couples shared more (though not all) responsibilities equally, including the biggie: child care. Seventy-four percent of same-sex, dual-earner couples shared routine child-care tasks, versus 38 percent of the different-sex couples. Gay couples also shared responsibility more equally for staying home when a child was sick (62 percent versus 32 percent.) That's huge -- taking on primary responsibility for sick days can keep both women and men from advancing at work.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe findings show that it may not be necessary for one parent in a dual-earner couple to take on \\u003Cem\\u003Eall\\u003C/em\\u003E of the child care duties.

Those who had a conversation about household responsibilities upon moving in together reported higher satisfaction than those who had wanted to talk but did not.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n“Biting your tongue hurts longer than you think,” Kenneth Matos, senior director of research at the Institute and author of the study, told The Huffington Post.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"happy chart\\\" src=\\\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3034578/original.jpg\\\" /\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nStaying silent is a particularly common experience for women who are in partnerships with men. Twenty percent of women in heterosexual relationships reported that they hadn’t talked about household responsibilities with their partners even though they had wanted to. By comparison, only 15 percent of women in same-sex couples remained silent on the matter. Just 11 percent of men in both kinds of relationships stayed mum.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe takeaway here isn’t just that women should speak up, Matos said.

The Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) will cover services ranging from professional work to e-commerce and financial services among the United States, the European Union, and 23 other countries. As with other new trade agreements -- notably, the two massive trade deals currently under review with our Asian and European allies -- the TiSA negotiations remain classified. And as with those other trade deals, the negotiating texts -- which reveal the positions that our government advocates for at the deal-making stage -- are to be kept classified for five years \\u003Ci\\u003Eafter\\u003C/i\\u003E the agreement has been finalized, whether it comes into force or fails. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EServices are big business in the new global economy, comprising an \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://ustr.gov/TiSA\\\"\\u003Eestimated 75%\\u003C/a\\u003E of the U.S. economy. And unlike cross-border trade in goods -- largely covered by the WTO -- the governance of the trade in services is more haphazard and much less long-standing. The WTO's General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) is a complicated agreement with various opt-in and opt-out clauses, which allow WTO members a degree of autonomy in deciding which services areas they commit to open to foreign competition. One rationale for this degree of autonomy -- which is unlike the more general discipline on the trade in goods -- is that services aren't simply comparable \\\"goods\\\" to be traded. They are the product of complex national regulatory regimes and implicate important legislative decisions. To a first order of approximation at least, a barrel of crude oil is a barrel of crude oil, but what banking or architecture or e-commerce is varies widely across national contexts.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe TiSA represents, in essence, a first step in crafting a new global regime for governing the cross-border flow of services. A great deal of the work that any services agreement must do is definitional, since services can be amorphous and are often controlled by national licensing schemes or one kind or another. Liberalizing the trade in services thus runs up against the difficulty of defining when a national law constitutes improper \\\"discrimination\\\" against foreign competitors in a service sector. As might be imagined, liberalizing agreements often have a \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.alliancesud.ch/en/policy/trade/download-trade/140623_TISA-Position_Alliance%20Sud_ENG.pdf\\\"\\u003Ederegulatory\\u003C/a\\u003E effect, as different national licensing and oversight regimes are harmonized downwards. And since important services from broadcasting to utilities to health care are provisioned publicly in a wide range of countries, these trade agreements can have a \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.world-psi.org/en/psi-special-report-tisa-versus-public-services\\\"\\u003Eprivatizing\\u003C/a\\u003E effect, requiring countries to open sectors to private competition or to eliminate government support.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn the case of TiSA, academics and activists studying the leaked drafts have already noted some of this deregulatory and privatizing pressure. Longstanding systems of public service provision in areas ranging from transport to broadcasting to utilities look likely to be come under new scrutiny. Financial regulations and safeguards -- including Dodd-Frank -- may be further eroded under this agreement, under the guise of financial service liberalization. Equally worrying are the negotiations covering e-commerce, which reveal U.S. efforts to oppose the \\\"data localization\\\" that privacy advocates support as a buffer against surveillance. Other points of concern will surely emerge over the coming days from the leaked drafts. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut as we take in each new revelation, we must not lose sight of the broader context. The Obama administration's proposed trade agreements -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), and now TiSA -- are not really about \\\"free trade\\\" as conventionally understood. They represent instead the inauguration of a new form of global governance, which proceeds under the mantle of trade liberalization. What these agreements deliver are new forms of cross-border regulation, often with sweeping and understudied impacts on the domestic economy. The regulation of our utilities, our roads, our health-care systems, our banks, our media now comes through a mechanism developed in the post-war era to address high tariff rates. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnd there is one overriding fact to bear in mind over the coming week. The same \\\"fast track\\\" authorization that will soon be debated in the House of Representatives doesn't just concern the controversial TPP and TTIP. Later this year or next, it will be used to provide special, expedited review for TiSA as well. For fast track -- now called \\\"Trade Promotion Authority\\\"--will last for \\u003Ci\\u003Esix years\\u003C/i\\u003E. Thus, after Obama's term is finished, through the next Presidential administration, and until 2021, the special treatment decided on this coming week will be used to push through future \\\"trade\\\" agreements that may address any activity that crosses a border -- which is to say, almost anything of importance in today's world.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhat the latest WikiLeaks release reminds us is that fast track won't just be used to pass the TPP. It will also be used to pass the TTIP, the TiSA, and future agreements not yet leaked -- perhaps not even yet imagined. If the House authorizes fast track next week, we should expect even more \\\"government by trade agreement\\\" over the coming years. Behind closed doors, in the offices of lobbying firms and corporate boardrooms, law firms and foreign ministries, smart people working for special interests will be empowered to reshape the world, through secret negotiations, and under the banner of \\\"free trade.\\\"\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EThe author is an Associate Professor at Yale Law School, where he teaches international trade law.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T13:49:02-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-singh-grewal/tisa-leak_b_7514314.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-singh-grewal/tisa-leak_b_7514314.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:49:02 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Another Leaked Trade Agreement, Another Reason to Oppose Fast Track"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 21:15:42 UTC +00:00]]

She talked about accepting ourselves for who we are and for recognizing that even with faults, we have plenty to offer to others.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nShe also, in one five-second segment of the 14-minute long talk, referred to me as a feminist. But she left me wiggle room in the way she worded it. \\\"Someone who's a feminist,\\\" she said. Not, \\\"he calls himself a feminist.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBecause she knows, I don't call myself a feminist.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI don't refrain from calling myself a feminist because I'm afraid of the men's rights groups who may come after me. I don't refrain from it because I don't agree with the oft-quoted definition of feminism as \\\"the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI refrain from calling myself a feminist because it seems too easy for a man to call himself a feminist and get credit for it. Like simply saying he's a feminist puts him on the same level as the women who have done so for years, often suffering more just because they've used the word as an identifier. I refrain because I know there are groups who would rather men not play a role in this fight and I accept that given their own experiences, there is value to that. I'm not as educated as these people are when it comes to feminism and the fight for equality. I haven't had insults hurled at me, physical threats thrown at me or any rights taken away because I'm a woman.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"But I have a voice and I can help,\\\" isn't always a sufficient answer.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe truth is, I've been a part of the problem far more frequently than I've been part of any solution to equality. I've been the asshole making sexist jokes. To suggest I've become someone equally engaged in the fight for equality as some of the people I've come to meet over the past few years seems disingenuous. That because I've written words out, I'm suddenly the same as people like my partner who has worked to help women make the choices that are right for them, is ludicrous.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI consider myself a feminist ally. Someone who believes strongly in the need for equality for all people who identify how ever they identify. Someone who wants to listen to people who have experienced inequalities I can only read about. Someone who some will call a feminist and who others won't. I'm okay with that.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI don't want to mansplain, I don't want to push my way to the front of a movement because I have the privilege to be able to do so. I don't want to compare the few angry blog comments I get to the copy and paste death threats some get for suggesting men are the most frequent perpetrators of sexual assault.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIt feels too easy to be a man and to write #feminist in your twitter bio or to wear your this is what a feminist looks like t-shirt and receive immediate accolades for being so \\\"progressive.\\\" These things only seem progressive because we haven't been acting out our male feminism long enough. It seems far more impactful for me to become an engaged bystander, to call out sexist, misogynistic behavior when I see it, even if it's coming from my friends. To support organizations who have been doing this for years and to look to these experts on how we can help end sexual violence against women. Or, at a very simple level, to talk to parents about how we can introduce our kids to the concept of consent at the age of two and that doing so doesn't mean they'll be engaged in sexual activity at the age of seven.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI'm a partner to a feminist, I'm committed to raising feminist daughters. I want them to know that I support them and believe them and will fight with them not because they're my girls but because they're girls at all. That we'd do the same for their friends or for someone we've never met.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nDo I like being called a feminist by feminists? Yes, very much. It makes me think my actions must be useful. It makes me think I might be doing something to make the world a little more equitable for our girls. I like the word, it gives me direction.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut there's always so much more to learn and there's always so much more I could be doing. So much more I could stop ignoring.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIt's a flawed stance to take, I know and one that might indeed change.

They are on a mission to keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates until the economy sees real wage growth. It is a cause that they argue is essential to raising living standards and reducing income inequality, and they are making their case in policy papers, meetings with Federal Reserve officials and yes, even demonstrations. They believe that President Barack Obama has neglected the Fed -- \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-25/obama-running-out-of-time-to-fill-vacant-fed-board-seats\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Eeven failing to fill two vacant seats\\u003C/a\\u003E on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors -- to the detriment of paychecks around the country.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe progressive economists and activists merely recognize what Wall Street has long accepted as true: The Fed’s monetary policy is one of if not the most important single factors in the real economy. In that battle to guide Fed policy, Wall Street is joined by \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/16/rick-perry-ben-bernanke-treasonous\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Ethe GOP\\u003C/a\\u003E, which routinely pressures the Fed to rein itself in.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe degree to which the Fed turns the faucet of money on or off has a direct effect on the jobs available to Americans -- and the wages they are able to demand once they are working. In fact, slowing wage growth is a feature of Fed policy, not a bug. A decision to limit the flow of money, even if based on sound concerns about inflation, is designed to lower prices by putting thousands of Americans out of work and driving down wage growth.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nJanet Yellen, a liberal-leaning economist who has long focused on wage growth, runs the Fed. Progressives successfully championed her for the post, derailing the bid of Obama’s top pick of Larry Summers, yet there has barely been a peep from them as Yellen and her colleagues consider putting the brakes on the economy.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nTo understand the case the progressives are making, it's important to know a little bit about the Fed, how it works and why it matters so much to the American economy.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EHow Does The Fed Work?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn controlling the country’s money supply, the Federal Reserve System, more commonly known as the “Fed,” is charged with what is often called a \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/speeches/our-dual-mandate-background\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E“dual mandate”\\u003C/a\\u003E: maximizing employment and maintaining stable prices. It does this primarily by adjusting the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EFederal Funds Rate\\u003C/a\\u003E, which is the interest rate at which banks lend to one another overnight using funds kept at the Federal Reserve. (It also can adjust the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/discountrate.htm\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EDiscount Rate\\u003C/a\\u003E, which is the rate at which the Fed lends to banks directly.) The Fed body responsible for adjusting the rate is the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EFederal Open Market Committee\\u003C/a\\u003E, which consists of 12 members -- seven presidentially appointed Federal Reserve Board governors, including the chair of the Fed, and a rotating group of five regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHow the Fed chooses to adjust the money supply is what is known as monetary policy. In a weak economy, the Fed is inclined to engage in monetary stimulus, which means lowering rates to prompt a virtuous cycle of economic growth. Banks respond to the cheaper credit available to them by providing cheaper credit to consumers and businesses. Consumers benefit from lower interest rates on home mortgages, cars and student loans. Businesses get lower interest rates on the loans they need to pay employees, maintain inventory and pay other bills. The money consumers and business owners save on financing their debt then gets cycled back into the economy in demand for goods and services. This in turn stimulates hiring, lowering unemployment and ultimately raising wages as employers compete for workers.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIf economic growth gets higher than the Fed believes is consistent with its inflation target, the Fed contracts the money supply, raising rates to prevent excessive inflation. That is because if debt remains cheap, wages could grow so high that businesses must constantly raise prices to remain afloat. People’s financial assets decline in value, as does the purchasing power of workers’ wages. The Fed adjusts rates with a target of 2 percent inflation, in an effort to avoid levels of inflation that would “\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/economy_14400.htm\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Ereduce the public's ability\\u003C/a\\u003E to make accurate longer-term economic and financial decisions.”\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n  \\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote\\\"\\u003EProgressives successfully championed her for the post, derailing the bid of Obama’s top pick of Larry Summers, yet there has barely been a peep from them as Yellen and her colleagues consider putting the brakes on the economy.\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhile the 2 percent target has become sacred in Fed policy circles, it is based on no more evidence than any other figure -- and those other figures, such as target unemployment, are adjusted routinely. Taking some of the halo off the 2 percent number, some economists argue, would give the Fed much more flexibility to help workers. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThere is a human cost to the Fed raising rates. People lose their jobs, and wages decrease. This can help businesses keep prices down, when rising wages might otherwise create pressure to increase prices. A rate hike also has a disproportionate effect on low-income communities of color, since people in those communities are often the last to see jobs and wage growth return after a recession and suffered from higher unemployment rates and lower wages than their white peers to begin with.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe Fed, liberal economists say, is planning to cause all of this pain with precious little evidence that it is even remotely necessary.

Paul Volcker, Fed chair from 1979 to 1987, increased interest rates to wipe out high inflation, allowing the unemployment rate to reach almost 11 percent in 1982. Since then, the Fed has shifted its monetary policies modestly based on circumstances. But with rare exception, it has not allowed unemployment to get low enough to generate significant wage growth for the large majority of American workers.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe severity of the recent recession yielded an unusually broad consensus in favor of keeping rates low. Since 2008, under both the Republican-appointed Fed chair, Ben Bernanke, and the current Democrat-appointed chair, Yellen, the federal funds rate has remained at what is known as the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthasharf/2014/10/29/fed-cuts-monthly-asset-purchases-to-0-as-qe-comes-to-long-awaited-end/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E“zero lower bound”\\u003C/a\\u003E – between 0 and 0.25 percent.

At the time, Greenspan repeatedly declined to raise rates, claiming that the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/27/business/job-insecurity-of-workers-is-a-big-factor-in-fed-policy.html\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E“softness in compensation growth”\\u003C/a\\u003E continued to make employment a greater concern than inflation. In doing so, Greenspan faced down criticism both from the financial industry and dissent from Fed committee members like \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/business/02fed.html\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EYellen, then the Fed governor\\u003C/a\\u003E. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe result of Greenspan’s decision, many argue, was one of the few periods of broadly distributed wage growth since before the 1973 recession. From 1995 to 2000, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.epi.org/blog/real-hourly-wage-growth-last-generation/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Ethe bottom 20 percent of workers\\u003C/a\\u003E saw double-digit wage increases.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIt is an odd turn considering that Greenspan’s handling of the dot-com and housing bubbles, and libertarian ideology, have made him a bête noire of the left.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n“A lot of economists do not like to acknowledge it, but Greenspan -- and I have trashed him endlessly -- was not an orthodox economist,” Dean Baker said. “Greenspan did something nobody thought was right, and he was right. High school degree workers were getting pay raises. It was not Clinton, but Greenspan who did it.”\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThese economists believe that postponing a rate hike is risk-free, because price inflation has remained defiantly low for so long. From April 2014 to April 2015, personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy -- the metric the Fed uses to measure inflation -- went up just over 1 percent, according to the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=9\\u0026step=1#reqid=9\\u0026step=3\\u0026isuri=1\\u0026903=81\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EBureau of Economic Analysis\\u003C/a\\u003E. That level of price inflation occurred during a period in which the economy created nearly 2.8 million more jobs, bringing the official unemployment rate from 6.2 percent to 5.4 percent, according to the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t01.htm\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EBureau of Labor Statistics\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn the long term, Bivens and Baker would like to see the Fed be altogether more concerned about wages and employment than inflation. They believe that the Fed’s price inflation target could go higher than 2 percent without tolerating dangerous inflation rates. A higher inflation target would have allowed the Fed to pursue a more aggressive quantitative easing program and push wages upward faster.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBaker says that the Fed should be most concerned about the rate at which prices are inflating, rather than a particular percentage range. And he believes that an uptick in inflation is rarely so abrupt as to be beyond adjustment.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n“If we had a jump in inflation even from 1.5 percent to 2 percent and then 2.5 the next month, then I’d say we should hit on the brakes,” Baker said.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOther economists from major world financial bodies, like Olivier Blanchard of the International Monetary Fund and Eric Rosengren of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/business/economy/2-inflation-rate-target-is-questioned-as-fed-policy-panel-prepares-to-meet.html\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Ehave also publicly endorsed\\u003C/a\\u003E higher inflation targets.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMore conservative economists argue that even if prices remain stable and low, a rate hike would head off asset inflation in, for example, the housing and stock markets. Mark Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute, expressed concern that the Fed’s low interest rates have allowed financial asset prices and corporate leveraging to reach “disconcerting” levels.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe liberal economists share Calabria’s concerns about asset bubbles, but believe that the Fed has tools other than raising interest rates at its disposal to address them.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThey note that the Fed has the power to regulate the banks and other commercial institutions with which it does business.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe Fed, they say, also has a bully pulpit that can be used to dampen the excessive expectations of growth in a particular industry that lead assets to be overvalued.

She just never imagined the challenges that she would face in getting there. Hareth arrived in the United States without her parents at an early age, and it was years before she would see them again. They stayed behind in Bolivia, hoping that their daughter would have better opportunities in the United States.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWith time, Hareth adapted to her new reality and excelled in school. She attended Washington High School in Arlington, Virginia, where she took Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate classes.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHareth worked hard and her future looked bright. But one day, while visiting a University of Virginia camp for high school students interested in science, she learned that she would face challenges in pursuing her dreams because she was undocumented. Like many DREAMers, even though she worked hard and felt as American as her peers, she didn't have the paperwork to prove it.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHareth explained, \\\"I had heard about Social Security numbers, but I didn't know what that was. We didn't talk about it at home. One of the panelists was talking about financial aid and Social Security numbers. I was puzzled, so I asked, 'What if someone doesn't have a Social Security number?' The response was something I did not expect. It felt like a slap in the face.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nGiven her accomplishments in school and her talents, Hareth's opportunities seemed endless. However, after discovering the barriers to higher education that her undocumented status posed, she felt uncertain about her future. Thanks to the inspiration from her guidance counselor, Hareth realized that she could use her talents to push for policy change, so she started advocating for Congress to allow students like her, who had grown up in the U.S., to continue their education and pursue their dreams in the country they call home.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAfter graduating from high school, Hareth, along with other students, founded DREAMers of Virginia, an organization that has led efforts to provide access to in-state tuition for people who came to the United States as children and graduated from high school in Virginia.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nShe remembers when President Obama announced Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Hareth applied in the summer of 2012 and shortly after received her documents, including her work permit, in the mail. \\\"The day I got the card, I called my mom crying, and I told her, 'Mom, it's happening! I am going to do all these things I want to do.'\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nNow Hareth's life has changed in ways large and small. \\\"Before it was so limiting,\\\" she said. \\\"One time I could not get into the movie theater to watch the newest Harry Potter movie. I had to show ID to prove I was 18 years old, but since the movie theater staff didn't take my student ID and I had no state-issued ID, I was not let in. When I held DACA in my hands, it meant so much to me.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSince receiving DACA, Hareth transferred from community college to Trinity Washington University, where she is pursuing a degree in international affairs. She expects to graduate next year and obtain a job in that field.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThanks to DACA, there is a clear path for young people like Hareth to enter the workforce. \\\"Applying for jobs has felt like an accomplishment. Writing my Social Security number on a piece of paper felt like an accomplishment. My entire life has been based on this number.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHareth has continued to advocate for opportunities for her peers. In 2014, DREAMers of Virginia was instrumental in securing access to in-state tuition in Virginia. Today DACA recipients are eligible to pay in-state tuition at some of Virginia's colleges and universities, keeping higher education within reach.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhen asked what she would like to see next, Hareth said, \\\"I would like to see my parents included in DAPA [Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents]. These programs shape lives. Our society can't exclude the people who help the most. Otherwise we are not helping our country move forward.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EThis was first posted to the\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://blog.nclr.org/2015/06/03/living-the-american-dream-hareth-andrade/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E NCLR Blog\\u003C/a\\u003E. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T13:48:48-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/national-council-of-la-raza-/living-the-american-dream_b_7514360.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/national-council-of-la-raza-/living-the-american-dream_b_7514360.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:48:48 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Living the American Dream: Hareth Andrade"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 21:15:42 UTC +00:00]]

As a kid, standing out from the status quo is celebrated. You're encouraged to not only be you but to be your best self. The world is your oyster! So why would you follow along what everyone else is doing, just because everyone else is doing it? Why would you jump off the bridge, just because all of your friends are doing it?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWell somewhere along the line of growing up, this little saying gets flipped on its head.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nInstead of questioning why you decide to follow along with the crowd, people now question those who veer from the norm. Thinking differently suddenly becomes discouraged. You're not a child anymore; standing out isn't how the status quo works. Button up your shirt, put on your tie and get in line, because that's what everyone else is doing. So why wouldn't you?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI've been on a bit of a self-help book spree for the past year, and I just started what is sure to become a new favorite of mine, \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Art of Non-Conformity\\u003C/em\\u003E by Chris Guillebeu. In it, he summarizes this idea perfectly.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHe writes that as adults, the tables have now changed. \\\"People start expecting you to behave very much like they do. It's almost as if they are asking: 'Hey, everyone else is jumping off the bridge. Why aren't you?'\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nStep away from the norm, and you're immediately in the spotlight. Think differently and people will immediately question your decisions. While asking \\\"why?\\\" every other minute as a child was acceptable, it's just not tolerated in adulthood. You just do.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhy? Because everyone else is doing it.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI don't know about you, but I'm in favor of the childhood warning. I think our society desperately needs to take it to heart: if everyone else jumped off the bridge, would you? Have you? Are you living the life that \\u003Cem\\u003Eyou\\u003C/em\\u003E want, or one by someone else's design?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIf you've taken the time to step back and reflect on your values and priorities, decide how you want to live your life and still decide to jump head first off that bridge, then power to you! You're much better off than most. You may be jumping right on in with the crowd, but you're jumping because you want to, not because of what anyone else is doing.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe reality is, the bridge isn't going anywhere. The pressures we all feel from our friends, family, coworkers, and society are real. And whether we like to admit it or not, they affect the decisions we make - from where we work, to who we date, to where we live, to what we wear.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut here's the catch: \\u003Cem\\u003EYou\\u003C/em\\u003E are in control of how much these pressures play into your life and decisions.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nGuillebeu adds, \\\"The presence of the bridge and the expectations of other people are somewhat unavoidable. Whether you jump or not, however, is entirely up to you.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSo my question to you is: Are you jumping off the bridge or are you standing on your own?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EThis post was originally published on \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.quarterforyourcrisis.com/jumping-off-the-bridge/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EQuarter for Your Crisis\\u003C/a\\u003E, a catalyst for Millennials to reconnect with themselves, their faith, and the world around them.\\u003C/em\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T13:48:14-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jordan-dansky/but-everyone-else-is-doin_b_7510374.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jordan-dansky/but-everyone-else-is-doin_b_7510374.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:48:14 UTC +00:00], ["title", "But Everyone Else Is Doing It..."], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 21:15:42 UTC +00:00]]

Abrams\",\"description\":\"The abdication of Sepp Blatter as President of FIFA offers to the world football community significant challenges and opportunities. Blatter has announced that he will remain in charge of FIFA until a successor is elected at least six months from now.  Until then, he can do much mischief. Federal prosecutors are 4,000 miles away, and the records that would document FIFA's perfidy must be preserved. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\tThe sniping began immediately upon Blatter's announcement.  The host countries for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups - Russia and Qatar -- are most at risk as the investigations into bribery and payoffs continue apace. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n          Many think that it was the preposterous decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar that finally led to the indictments and the arrest of much of the FIFA leadership, sans Blatter. However, Qatar's Foreign Minister Khaled al-Attiyah's response was swift, the first of many likely to come. This campaign against Qatar, he said, was the product of Western \\\"prejudice against Arab Islamic states.\\\" He did not mention the allegations of graft, corruption, bribery and other misdeeds, such as the systematic abuse of migrant workers that would likely lead to thousands of deaths of construction workers.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\t Blatter maintained his iron grip on FIFA power by following the best practices of Nineteenth Century American political bosses. He was able to buy votes. Under FIFA's voting system, revised in 2011, each of the 209 member countries has an equal vote - Montserrat, Samoa, Tahiti, Bhutan, Guam, Togo, Chad, Seychelles, each with a modest population, has the same single vote as China with a population of 1.36 billion. To insure political support for FIFA's leadership, FIFA made grants from its substantial largess in about equal amounts to each member country, thus disproportionately favoring smaller countries. When it was time to vote, those favored countries remembered the source of their most-favored-nation status.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\tThe transition to a transparent system of organizing and regulating world football will not be easy, especially as the number of indicted officials increases, something that seems quite likely. If there is evidence that Russia and Qatar bribed voters to obtain their World Cups, their statuses will be placed in doubt, although it is likely too late to alter plans for 2018. The potential for conflict between the major football playing countries, like England, Germany, France, Spain, Brazil and Italy, and the less significant countries may be impossible to avoid. The major football-playing countries were the nations that threatened to blow up the FIFA World Cup by creating an alternate world tournament. Those with a pragmatic and accomplished understanding of the structures of the world's premier sport should be busy formulating the architecture of this new football world. The hundred or so countries that only dream of making it to a World Cup are not likely to be benefited by whatever new world order is devised.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\tAs usual, football fans have been left out of the mix. No one has asked them whether FIFA should be thoroughly deloused. We should not doubt the importance of football in the lives of everyday people who wear their colors proudly. While they certainly would not endorse the alleged racketeering of the FIFA Mafia, they have other priorities. They want nothing to interfere with the matches as scheduled.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIt is too early to celebrate. Many criminal defense lawyers and prosecutors have their work cut out for them. There will be efforts made to \\\"flip\\\" the many who will be accused and discover more wrongdoing in the process. This cleansing exercise will only go on once, and any institution that has fallen into corrupt alleyways can do so again if the infection is not totally cut out. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\tIn the meanwhile, it is too early to book your flights to Qatar.  It will not be surprising if the reformed FIFA under new leadership were to revote on what country will host the 2022 World Cup. Think of all the lives of the South Asian migrant workers that will be saved! \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T13:46:56-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/roger-i-abrams/reconstructing-fifa_b_7514340.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/roger-i-abrams/reconstructing-fifa_b_7514340.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:46:56 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Reconstructing FIFA"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 21:15:42 UTC +00:00]]

Wait? What? Really? They've got to be kidding.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHe's spent only 48 months on this earth, and he's old enough for an organized sport? I would later learn that \\\"organized\\\" in regards to 4-year old T-ball is a generous word. However, yes, for organized T-ball Jack was, indeed, eligible, if questionably capable.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI spent a few weeks deciding whether I should sign him up. It seemed too early. By starting now, surely, he'd be worn out and washed up by 12. He'd then turn to drugs and by 16, I'd be shopping rehab facilities. T-ball having served as the gateway drug.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHowever, I was also well-aware that Jack's athletic gene pool was probably pretty shallow, so if he wanted to play, I better give him any head start he could get. So I drank the Kool-Aid and hopped on the the ride to nowhere.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI soon learned that there would be a T-ball draft. Yep. This is a real situation. Coaches actually get together and haggle for players, half of whom can't even wipe their own butts, my son among them.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nJack was drafted to the Devil Rays, and his first practice was scheduled.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThat practice. The Devil Rays looked like castaways on the island of misfit toys. And the poor well-intended coach handed Jack a bat -- on purpose -- not knowing that Jack would rather swing the bat at his teammates like a sword than try and hit the ball.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWatching a group of 4-year-old boys play their first game is like watching tiny aliens arrive on planet earth. As a majority, they have no clue what's happening or why. And if you're Jack, you really don't care. Here's what Jack does care about during his T-ball game:\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n1. Making a perfect dirt angel while he mans second base\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n2. Licking the inside of his hat\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n3. Picking his nose\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n4. Picking grass out of the outfield, running it into the infield and throwing it at this teammates. The ball? Oh that probably just whizzed on by him. He'd rather lick his hat.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nJack likes to hit the ball off the tee and then hurl the bat -- usually the bat goes farther than the ball. He then likes to gallop, skip or run backwards to first base. Even with his theatrics, he usually makes it on base courtesy of the the absurdity and hilarity of 4 year old T-ball.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIt's like the wild wild west out on that field. Balls flying, bats swinging. Kids running in all directions. No rules apply. If Jack decides he'd rather play pitcher, he goes and shoves the pitcher off the mound. If a player is running to third base and Jack doesn't like the look of him, he blocks him like a linebacker. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThere are no rules in Jack's wild wild west T-ball show except one: You always slide home. Running home? Slide! Going up to the plate to bat? Slide!! And why throw the ball home and make the out when you can run it in and... slide! \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe bring Jack home looking like he got bombed with dirt. But he's really bombed on sugar. After the game comes Jack's favorite part of playing T-ball -- a trip to the concession stand. God bless the concession stand for feeding my family dinner (and dessert!) four nights a week.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nNot surprisingly, the Devil Rays are 0-10. Which is horrible, except if you're Jack. Win? Lose? It doesn't matter to him. That's the best part of 4-year-old T-ball. The scoreboard, for these days, for these kids, doesn't exist. This won't always be true. Some day, in the near future, there will be winners, there will be losers but this summer, out on the field, all that matters is sliding home.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-04-1433432372-6755612-11357237_10206769993949974_8250146779136663687_o.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-06-04-1433432372-6755612-11357237_10206769993949974_8250146779136663687_o.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-04-1433432372-6755612-11357237_10206769993949974_8250146779136663687_o-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"380\\\" height=\\\"570\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/center\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T13:45:37-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/abbie-rumbach/always-slide-home_b_7511604.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/abbie-rumbach/always-slide-home_b_7511604.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:45:37 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Always Slide Home"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 21:15:42 UTC +00:00]]

It was April, and the Alberta air was just starting to recover from a mildly cold winter. Blue sky popped through the small window in my log cabin room. What my grandma was referring to was a nomad's checklist that would encompass the last four years of my life: a high school career spanning sixteen countries and six continents. Athens was to be my last journey with THINK Global School (TGS). Socks, pants, button-ups, longboards: the habitual packing routine for each high school semester. The only difference this time was the inclusion of graduation clothes.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cimg src=\\\"http://thinkglobalschool.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/taj.png\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI left my home in Canada in 2011, and now I am facing leaving home at TGS.

It's a place where forty-six students and ten teachers become family, learn about how the world can be so different, yet realize that we are quite the same. It's a different kind of home. To me, my grandma's question was asking if I'm ready to leave this multicultural family and international opportunity.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cimg src=\\\"http://thinkglobalschool.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hike.png\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHave I crossed everything off my list?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIf I sum up this archive of memories, am I satisfied with this list of milestones?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI remember a young mind with long hair, clammy palms, and a full belly from his first international meal. I was in Quito, Ecuador, 'the country with the Amazon rainforest and the giant tortoises of the Galapagos.' Ecuador provided the prospect of many checked bucket list items. But now, I understand how premature my understanding was of Ecuador and the subsequent fifteen countries I would visit. I was never one to spend hours looking online at the major destinations in my host countries. In a way, I could feel ashamed of my premature knowledge of the countries I visited; however, I found that this worked to my own advantage. An element of discovery presented itself with each journey.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cimg src=\\\"http://thinkglobalschool.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hear.png\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe first time I discovered the unexpected in the world was my first impression of the Amazon rainforest: indescribable beauty tainted by the flames and factory piping from oil rigs. Another instance was when I discovered the magnitude of the overfishing issue in Tsukiji (Tokyo's massive fish market). Yet another moment was when I calculated that the TGS students wasted over 7,000 water bottles in Buenos Aires, a discovery made when Alejandro, my mate and friend, and I collected and recycled the plastic waste from each meal.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cimg src=\\\"http://thinkglobalschool.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/recycle.png\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn retrospect, each country presented at least one environmental issue that became close to my heart and has since flourished into a passion to affect change in that area. After four years of this traveling business, it's clear to me this is a small world, and every environment is affected negatively by human activity. Scattered through my four years, I experienced over and over again a sensation of \\\"wow, this isn't seeing the world; it's seeing \\u003Cem\\u003Eour\\u003C/em\\u003E world.\\\"\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cimg src=\\\"http://thinkglobalschool.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/costa.png\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ETHINK Global School isn't changing the world; instead, it's cultivating individuals who will positively influence it. When I look at my peers, I see strong, brave, and passionate new minds. We are the forward-thinking byproduct of a forward-thinking educational institution. We have become thinkers as a result of the time and care given from all TGS staff. We have become actors as a result of the support from our families. We have become changemakers as a result of what the world has shown us.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe have become thinkers, actors, and changemakers.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cimg src=\\\"http://thinkglobalschool.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/isaac.png\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMy gratitude branches off in many directions: the people and culture from our host countries, the friends made along the way, all members of staff, and, of course, my parents. Even those who cleaned our dorms, made meals for a table of 40 every lunch break, and the bus drivers shouldn't go unrecognized.

Now that the end is on the horizon, I have put a great deal of thought into what my next steps toward that reality will be. Everyone has their niche for aid, whether it be humanitarian, political, or environmental. Through THINK Global School, I have discovered that mine is the latter. I decided to make a different kind of bucket list - one that applies the TGS-taught skills and values to the environmental issues I've witnessed in the real world. It presents a collection of serious global issues that should have the attention of the public, but are commonly neglected.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI dream not of seeing the world, but seeing the world change.

Pro Publica \\u0026 Times: \\\"\\u003CStrong\\u003EWithout public notice or debate, the Obama administration has expanded the National Security Agency's warrantless surveillance of Americans' international Internet traffic\\u003C/strong\\u003E to search for evidence of malicious computer hacking, according to classified NSA documents. In mid-2012, Justice Department lawyers wrote two secret memos permitting the spy agency to begin hunting on Internet cables, without a warrant and on American soil, for data linked to computer intrusions originating abroad -- including traffic that flows to suspicious Internet addresses or contains malware, the documents show. The Justice Department allowed the agency to monitor only addresses and 'cybersignatures' -- patterns associated with computer intrusions -- that it could tie to foreign governments. But the documents also note that the NSA sought to target hackers even when it could not establish any links to foreign powers. The disclosures, based on documents provided by Edward J. Snowden, the former NSA contractor, and shared with the New York Times and ProPublica, come at a time of unprecedented cyberattacks on American financial institutions, businesses and government agencies, but also of greater scrutiny of secret legal justifications for broader government surveillance.\\\" [\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/04/snowden-surveillance-expanding_n_7511428.html\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ENYT \\u0026 ProPublica\\u003C/a\\u003E] \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003CStrong\\u003ECLINTON TO PUSH FOR UNIVERSAL \\u0026 AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION\\u003C/STRONG\\u003E - Hopefully she'll pose herself probing questions about this during her self-interview.

Clinton will also call for broader modernization of the voter registration system aimed at making it easier for Americans to register and stay on the rolls as they move or make other life changes. Those proposals, and others she will put forward Thursday at Texas Southern University—including a pitch to encourage all 50 states to allow at least 20 days of early voting—are squarely aimed at helping secure the franchise for the people most likely to encounter obstacles at the polls: the young, minorities and senior citizens.\\\" [\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-06-04/hillary-clinton-pushes-for-universal-voter-registration\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EBloomberg\\u003C/a\\u003E] \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ci\\u003EJohn McCain is tired of the NFL \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25205344/us-senators-seek-end-to-defense-spending-on-nfl-pro-sports-teams\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Edraping itself in the flag\\u003C/a\\u003E for money.\\u003C/i\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cb\\u003ETODAY IN 2016 TEDIUM\\u003C/b\\u003E: \\\"Former Florida Gov.

Although the order dismissed portions of Pebble's complaint, the court also allowed parts of the case to move forward to trial on the merits.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nNothing in the court's opinion suggests that Pebble is likely to prevail -- ultimately.  And nothing in the opinion changes the fact that the proposed Pebble Mine would  threaten the world's greatest wild salmon fishery in Bristol Bay, which supports a $1.5 billion annual commercial fishery, 14,000 jobs, and a subsistence way of life that has flourished for millennia. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-04-1433451560-3383987-bristolbay.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-06-04-1433451560-3383987-bristolbay.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-04-1433451560-3383987-bristolbay-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"570\\\" height=\\\"414\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThis opinion is not about whether EPA's Bristol Bay Watershed Assessment - which found that Pebble Mine would have significant and even catastrophic effects on the region - is scientifically sound.  It is. It was based on three years of data review, two rounds of peer review by 12 independent scientists, numerous public hearings and comment, and extensive scientific analysis and revision.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nNor is the opinion about whether EPA has the legal authority to restrict a mine like Pebble. It does. Under the Clean Water Act, EPA may, at any time, veto a project like the proposed Pebble Mine that would have \\\"unacceptable adverse impacts\\\" on the environment.  Congress enacted that authority decades ago, the D.C. Court of Appeals recently affirmed it, and Alaskans in overwhelming numbers have asked EPA to exercise it.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThis opinion is about procedure, not substance - that is, whether Pebble will be allowed to prove the allegations in its complaint that EPA violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) in its review of the Pebble Mine.  While it's unfortunate that the judge didn't dismiss the case outright - Pebble will now have judicial license to prolong the litigation through discovery and other litigation activities - it is undeniable that EPA's burden of proof on its motion to dismiss is extremely high.  At this stage, the judge was required to accept as \\\"true\\\" the factual allegations made by Pebble on the face of its complaint.  Once those allegations must be supported by actual evidence, EPA will unquestionably prevail. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSimply stated, the remaining question in the litigation is whether EPA violated the FACA by establishing and working with mining opponents in a way that, in effect, acted as advisory committees within the meaning of the Act.  EPA did not, but while the case moves forward, EPA cannot issue permanent restrictions to protect Bristol Bay from the specter of the Pebble Mine.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://secure.nrdconline.org/site/Advocacy;jsessionid=9C80026272CA402E0EBF41A432917B9B.app322a?cmd=display\\u0026page=UserAction\\u0026id=3365\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EClick here\\u003C/a\\u003E to tell Northern Dynasty Minerals - now the sole owner of Pebble - what you think of its legal stall tactics.

Roosevelt signed an order authorizing the relocation of nearly 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry, most of who were U.S. born citizens, to ten different Internment camps for the duration of World War II. After the camps were closed in November 1945, months after Japan surrendered, the stories of what went on at these camps was largely forgotten and dismissed by historical accounts of the era. It wouldn't be until 1992, nearly 50 years later, when the first Japanese Internment Camp, Manzanar, was designated a National Historic Site. The camp incarcerated 10,000 Japanese-Americans and Japanese Resident Aliens during the war. \\\"It was a desolate place. You had to know what you were looking for to find anything,\\\" says National Park Service Associate Director of Cultural Resources Stephanie Toothman.  \\\"The stories of the Japanese Internment Camps still weren't being told even after reparations and apologies were given to the families of those affected by the Reagan Administration in the 80s. What happened still wasn't even being taught in most schools by the time the first camp was designated a National Historic Site.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n       The designation of the site was due, in large part, to the efforts of the Manzanar Committee. \\\"My mother, Sue Kunitomi Embrey, was editor of the \\u003Cem\\u003EManzanar Free Press\\u003C/em\\u003E, the camp's newspaper, while incarcerated at the camp. After her release she became a devoted activist; she protested the Vietnam War, strongly supported the labor movement, worked on the campaign for the first elected Hispanic Congressman Edward Roybal, worked on campaigns of the first black mayor of Los Angeles, Tom Bradley, and served on the Los Angeles City Status of Women Commission. She started the committee in 1969 to organize a pilgrimage for surviving victims to the site and have Manzanar designated as a state landmark, which occurred in 1973. The committee continued the efforts until it became a National Historic Site in 1992,\\\" says Co-Chair of the Manzanar Committee Bruce Embrey. \\\"At the most recent pilgrimage at Manzanar, a woman spoke on how the camp affected her life. Her father was from Japan and her mother was from Montana. They were both brought to Manzanar in 1942 while her mother was pregnant with her. On arrival they were forced to take a loyalty oath to the United States and denounce Japan. The father refused and was deported. She never met her father because he was sent back to Japan, despite never committing a crime or ever being indicted.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n      Manzanar and other World War II Japanese Internment camps help create a greater dialogue about contemporary civil rights, presenting the good and bad in telling a difficult story of great shame and discrimination, connecting them with those same emotions felt today. \\\"Manzanar is a place where stories of our history are told; we remember so America never forgets,\\\" says Embrey. \\\"These stories are stark reminders of how fragile our democracy is and how the promises of our country fell short to prejudice policies all too often adopted in contradiction to the constitution.\\\" \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T14:00:09-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-sainato/grand-canyon-national-park-celebrates-asian-american-pacific-islander-heritage-month_b_7503274.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-sainato/grand-canyon-national-park-celebrates-asian-american-pacific-islander-heritage-month_b_7503274.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 21:00:09 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Grand Canyon National Park Celebrates Asian-American Pacific Islander Heritage Month"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 21:22:48 UTC +00:00]]

The \\\"coded racial appeals\\\" that Ian Haney Lopez has written in his informative book, \\\"Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism \\u0026 Wrecked The Middle Class,\\\" is must reading for all Americans and provides a foundation for how racism endures and evolves.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn this week's guest blog, Michael Holzman provides additional thought suggesting the moral debt America owes to African Americans.

The median wealth of non-Hispanic black households dropped by more than one-third between 2010 and 2013, to $13,700, according to the Pew Research Center, citing Federal Reserve data. Meanwhile, in 2013 the average white household wealth was 13 times greater -- $141,900 -- than that of black households, up from eight times greater than black households in 2010, Pew reported.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWealth is crucial for mobility. A family with a house and investments gives its children a good start in life -- a boost up the ladder, as it were. Wealth also means there is property, real and financial, to leave to those children through inheritance. This is how white parents help their children \\\"do better\\\" than they did on the wealth meter. Not so with black families. The number of black families with negative wealth -- more debt than assets -- vastly outnumbers the Oprahs of this world: Approximately 35 percent of African-American households have a zero or negative net worth, according to Pew. A few months of unemployment can wipe them out. As a consequence, black children are unlikely to earn and own more than their parents, greasing their slide \\u003Cem\\u003Edown\\u003C/em\\u003E the wealth ladder. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHome ownership is a key to wealth. More than 70 percent of white households own their homes, compared with just 43 percent of black families, according to the U.S. Census 2013 American Community Survey. The federal government is culpable, dating to the Jim Crow era of the twentieth century. Mortgage guarantees were made available for whites only under legislation passed during the Franklin Roosevelt administration that established the Federal Housing Authority. When the post-war housing boom arrived, the suburbs filled with FHA-mortgage houses populated by whites, and segregation became the moral imperative of home ownership. The prices of these houses gradually increased and by the 1960s, became significant sources of white wealth. By comparison, the majority of black families were (and are) renters, their incomes wasted from month to month in rent, with nothing to build equity and, as a result, wealth and mobility for their children. The inner cities became segregated, with little investment in schools and other resources. Even today, the average value of a black-owned house is $123,000, while a white-owned house is valued at nearly $175,000.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe wealth-gap statistics are disturbing, but their results are indisputable: A lack of educational opportunities, extraordinary incarceration rates, and overt racism have destroyed families and prevented millions of black Americans from fulfilling their potential.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFor this reason, the moral case for reparations is at least as strong for African Americans who have been terrorized in their own country as it was for Japanese Americans who were interned during World War II and eventually received monetary payments from the American government.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nRestitution also is in the responsibility of the private sector. Businesses have come forward to acknowledge their role in slavery and torture, and some have made financial amends. Though public, the French national railway compensated Holocaust survivors for the railway's role in transporting Jews who were sent to concentration camps. American insurance companies, banks and other corporations have been identified as profiting from slavery. Even the judicial system appreciates the wisdom of reparations. In the case \\u003Cem\\u003EIn Re \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://njlaw.rutgers.edu/collections/resource.org/fed_reporter/F3/471/471.F3d.754.html\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EAfrican-American Slave Descendants Litigation. appeals of Deadria Farmer-Paellmann, et al., and Timothy Hurdle, et al, 471 F.3d 754 \\u003C/a\\u003E(2006)\\u003C/em\\u003E, Circuit Court Appellate Judge Richard Posner said the problem is how to calculate damages from ancestral slavery for their descendants: \\\"There is no way to determine that a given black American today is worse off by a specific, calculable sum of money (or monetized emotional harm) as a result of the conduct of one or more of the defendants,\\\"  he said. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nJudge Posner raised a good point. If legal action against Aetna, Citibank, JP Morgan Chase and other corporations that once supported the slave trade succeeds in recovering significant funds, then how are these funds to be calculated and most effectively distributed to the descendants of enslaved Africans?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOne possibility would be to establish a Federal Black Housing Administration (FBHA) to guarantee mortgages for those able to establish they are descendants from enslaved Africans. The administrative regulations of the FBHA would support housing in resource-rich neighborhoods, with good schools and good transportation -- circumstances proven to improve educational outcomes, even for black children living in poverty. The FHA has a history of supporting underserved populations -- including veterans -- through such incentives as low- to no-cash down-payments, relaxed qualifications to buy, and flexibility on closing costs and other features. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThese programs lift families up and help them to create wealth. Mortgage guarantees for descendants of enslaved Africans fit that tradition.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMuch has been written about the cost of reparations. Scenarios vary and estimates can rise to hundreds of trillions of dollars. We can, however, take Judge Posner's advice and make a calculation. Considering the differences in value of home owned by whites and blacks, and the percentage of white and black families living in homes they own, we can estimate $1 trillion -- or approximately $70,000 for every black household -- is needed to close the housing wealth gap. This would meet the test of a quantifiable harm for the case for reparations.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn any event, there is little doubt that mortgage guarantees for African Americans would create better, stronger neighborhoods and ease the penalty for living in America while Black. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EEric J.

Congratulations.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhether you end up making it \\\"until death\\\" or not, the intention to spend decades with someone -- no matter how well you may know him or her -- seems somewhat daunting. While no one can guarantee that your marriage will be as happy and healthy as you expect it to be, wouldn't you feel better committing to all those years together if you had a way to measure your marriage's success by something other than longevity -- the only way we currently consider a marriage successful?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBelieve it or not, you do have a way; it's called a marital plan, a framework for your marriage that you and your spouse-to-be create together so you can define and agree to what will make your marriage a success. It's like a road map for your combined goals and dreams, with specifics on how you plan to accomplish them, and when. And it also holds each of you accountable.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAfter all, your partner is special -- you don't want to just create \\u003Cem\\u003Ea life\\u003C/em\\u003E with him or her; you want to create a \\u003Cem\\u003Especific kind\\u003C/em\\u003E of life. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhile Susan Pease Gadoua and I present such plans in our book \\u003Cem\\u003EThe New I Do: Reshaping Marriage for Skeptics, Realists and Rebels\\u003C/em\\u003E, we are not alone in believing that marital plans are the way of the future for anyone considering marriage, or even renegotiating an existing marriage. I chatted with two family and divorce attorneys who are big proponents of marital plans -- \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.bayareadivorce.com/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EMark Ressa\\u003C/a\\u003E, who practices in the San Francisco Bay Area, and \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://family-in-law.com/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EMichael Boulette\\u003C/a\\u003E, who practices in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EQ: Why do you like the idea of a marital plan?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ERessa:\\u003C/strong\\u003E Before they exchange \\\"I do's,\\\" rarely do couples articulate in a meaningful way what their expectations are for the marriage. What do they want to see happen in the first three to five years? Are they on the same page about having children? What about intimacy issues? Marital planning provides an opportunity to discuss these issues beforehand, see if both parties are on the same page and, more importantly, set expectations and plan how to address expectations that are not met. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EBoulette:\\u003C/strong\\u003E I've started to see marriage planning as an innovative solution for a number of the problems plaguing modern relationships. It's a way to: \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cul\\u003E\\u003Cli\\u003Eincrease marriage rates among couples that may not feel ready for marriage (in its current form) but who want to create a relationship that's more than just roommates \\u003C/li\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003Eincorporate changing social norms around what marriage means and to embrace a variety of different \\\"meanings\\\" of marriage without writing any one meaning into our laws\\u003C/li\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003Ehelp reduce the conflict in divorce by allowing couples to create their own ideas of fairness when they still have each other's best interests at heart\\u003C/li\\u003E\\u003C/ul\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EQ: How do you see a marital plan differing from a prenup?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ERessa: \\u003C/strong\\u003EPre- and post-nuptial agreements, if enforceable, dictate what happens in the event of a divorce. Marital plans document the parties' intent and expectations about how they will move through life as a married couple. A prenuptial agreement largely deals with financial issues; a marital plan, instead, focuses on lifestyle choices.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EBoulette:\\u003C/strong\\u003E Marriage planning is a paradigm shift. Marriage plans reach beyond the financial into questions of what you want from your spouse as a partner, as a friend, as a co-parent, what you're seeking from the marriage emotionally, physically, even professionally. And also what you're willing to give -- what you're committed to investing to make the relationship and the family work. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EQ: From your perspective as a family lawyer, what do couples ignore or misunderstand when they tie the knot?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ERessa: \\u003C/strong\\u003EMost couples do not consider what happens in the event of a divorce, how the standard-one-size-fits-all divorce laws would apply in their circumstance. Rarely do I hear of couples who are about to marry -- other than the small percentage who actually enter into a prenuptial agreement -- contemplate financial, wealth acquisition or parenting issues.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EBoulette:\\u003C/strong\\u003E Because getting married is so easy, at least from a legal standpoint, many couples avoid hard questions. Ignoring these questions can create conflict later on, and in the most extreme scenario could lead couples to question whether the relationship is right for them. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EInterested in creating a specific kind of marriage?

What better way to rejuvenate yourself than a brain holiday to shake out stale thinking and oh-so-familiar negative feelings? A great vacation is more than doing nothing; it's doing something that changes up your routine, renews your energy, improves your outlook, and helps you re-engage with your life.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHere are three ways to give yourself this replenishing break for your brain, even without a plane ticket or a night at a B\\u0026B.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ETake a Time Out\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhether it's a 20-minute coffee break or a few extra minutes on a park bench, a time out is well worth your time -- because it's the quality of that time that matters, and taking it as often as you can will refuel and recharge you. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWhen to use it. \\u003C/strong\\u003ETake a time out when negative thoughts and emotions are consistently getting the better of you. Are you too upset to talk with your spouse with kindness? Are you mired in self-doubt? Are you not just nursing but force-feeding a grudge? Then it's time to sit yourself out.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWhat it does.\\u003C/strong\\u003E A time out is, ideally, a pleasing, soothing interruption to reset your brain, mood, and day. It helps diffuse intense emotions and gives you a chance to step back from a negative stress response that could make your day a whole lot worse. Instead, you get a chance to make it better.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EGo on a mini-sabbatical\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003C/strong\\u003ERelaxing is one way to recharge; re-energizing and re-engaging is another. So another way to give yourself a mini-getaway and cultivate a time-off mindset is to dig into something that interests and compels you.  College professors regularly take sabbaticals, time away from their usual duties, to try new things, sink into a pet project, travel, meet new people. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYour mini-sabbatical might be as simple as watching a documentary that has nothing to do with work or anything else you usually watch or do. Or it could be inspiring yourself with a 20-minute TED talk. The key with a sabbatical is that it must rev up or engage part of your brain that you don't usually use. This helps give you a fresh perspective, new ideas, and renews your mental energy.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWhen to use it. \\u003C/strong\\u003ETake a mini-sabbatical when you're bored and worn down by drudge, when you're uninspired, when you look at your to-do list and see nothing fun on it.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWhat it does. \\u003C/strong\\u003EWhatever your job is, you need variety to keep your brain fresh, curious, and resilient.  A mini-sabbatical is an infusion of liveliness for that hardworking noggin.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EHave an Adventure\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYou don't have to go bungee jumping or off-roading in Mexico to have an adventure. The key to adventure is a small measure of risk, even if that risk means doing something out your normal routine. Where can you experiment with something you don't know well? Maybe it's visiting a nearby city that you rarely go to, trying a new kind of cuisine, or taking a class. The question to ask yourself is: What can I try that I haven't before?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWhen to use it.\\u003C/strong\\u003E When you're feeling hamstrung by habit and a little bored.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWhat it does.\\u003C/strong\\u003E Adventure jostles you out of the familiar.

And sorry, but we don't care how cute he is - you can't date a loser.  He won't make you feel good, and if the first date went that poorly, it's not going to get any better.  Don't give it another thought.  Just store him in your bad date memory bank and laugh about it with your girlfriends.  Don't waste your time getting down on yourself about it or down on men.

I just realized they're called drumsticks. It's the sort of curry you don't want to have when guests come home as these long beans can't be swallowed, so they are chewed and the skin discarded. And for this reason, the thick sauce is very important - it is really what makes the curry. When I started thinking about asparagus, since it's so in season, I finally decided that this is the exact sauce it needs. Something thick and rich yet light, as it's made with yoghurt and chickpea flour. The natural (homemade) curd makes the sauce deliciously sour - and if the yoghurt you use is thicker, then just squeeze some lime. It's the perfect complement to the full-flavored British asparagus. This can be eaten as a curry with rice or roti, or simply on its own.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n100g asparagus (around 15 asparagus spears)\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n1 tablespoons coconut oil\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n1 teaspoon cumin seeds\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\npinch asafetida\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n7-8 curry leaves\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EFor the sauce\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n1 clove of garlic\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n250g yoghurt\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n25g chickpea flour\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n60ml water\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n1 teaspoon salt\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n½ teaspoon turmeric\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n¼ teaspoon red chilli powder\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n½ teaspoon cumin powder\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n½ teaspoon coriander powder\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-28-1432807721-9911162-IMG_843711024x682.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-28-1432807721-9911162-IMG_843711024x682.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-28-1432807721-9911162-IMG_843711024x682-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"570\\\" height=\\\"379\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHeat the oil and cumin seeds in medium pan on low heat until cumin seeds are brown.

Once you do that, your eyes will be able to recognize real lies.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe must also know that a lie doesn't necessarily have to be a verbal statement that comes from someone's mouth.  It also can be an individual's personality, the way they carry themselves.  Their behavior can make you ask, 'Is that really who they are?'  The only way to know the answer to that question is to know who you are.  At the end of the day, it will always be better to be hated for who you are, then loved for who you're not.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003ESpecial thanks to Hope Sanford and \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/sinhuellascollective\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ESin Huellas\\u003C/a\\u003E, who visit, support, and advocate for the release of people detained at the Polk County Adult Detention Center and the Joe Corley Detention Facility in Texas.

And raw and incredibly moving. And at times difficult to take in and practice because it requires such courage and bravery to do.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAfter my husband and I split up, I had a number of friends who recommended that I listen to it. Nobody was of course suggesting I open myself up to being vulnerable anytime soon but those closest to me could see that the sweet, affectionate, loving, woman who had always worn her heart on her sleeve was most likely going to shut down completely after the betrayal I had just suffered. They were not wrong.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe protective box I built around myself was instantaneous and nobody was ever getting back in. The person I loved the most in this world had hurt me beyond anything I had ever experienced and I became convinced it was somehow my fault. \\u003Cem\\u003EWhy hadn't I seen it coming? How could I be such a poor judge of character?\\u003C/em\\u003E WAS I a poor judge of character or was what happened to me something that nobody could have seen coming, even the most intuitive and discerning person?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAs I lost trust in myself, I was surrounded by people who only reinforced that distrust. I remember my father driving me to the airport right after I found out my husband was not who I believed him to be and he said, \\\"Didn't you have any idea this guy was going to do this to you?\\\" \\u003Cem\\u003EUm. NO\\u003C/em\\u003E. Did YOU? Did ANY OF US? Of course I didn't know. I certainly wouldn't have consciously chosen a life partner who would break my heart. But seeing in his eyes that he would never trust my decisions again when it came to men broke my heart. Whether it was real or imagined, I took on the false story that I couldn't trust myself ever again.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAs I began slowly dating after my split, my well-meaning friends started to chime in. \\\"I just don't want to see you get hurt again.\\\" \\\"You really need to be careful.\\\" \\\"You have to be more discerning...\\\" \\\"You're too trusting of people...\\\" Yes.. I get it. At a time when my self-esteem was already at an all-time low, I began to feel that NOBODY trusted me or my ability as a grown woman to learn from my mistakes and make good decisions moving forward.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhen we have been hurt, it's a long and arduous process to trust ourselves again. To trust in the universe or God or whatever you believe in, that every relationship serves its purpose and we can't punish or beat ourselves up forever for what happened. And we definitely can't deprive ourselves of being loved by another person because we could get hurt again.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhen Brene Brown asked a group of people at one of her lectures how many of them would be willing to give up ever being loved again, not ONE of them raised their hand. \\u003Cem\\u003ENot one.\\u003C/em\\u003E That's because all of us NEED to be loved. And to find it and feel that beautiful, powerful connection, we have to take some risks. We have to reveal our true selves to another person, open ourselves up, put ourselves out there by sharing our feelings, not knowing if they feel the same way about us. And then, even if that person reciprocates our feelings, we will at times hurt each other. We won't always be in sync. That is part of being in relationship with people. It's part of loving.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI thought back just the other day to my very first love... the simplest, most pure, most innocent love I've ever known. I was just 16. And although we loved each other in our innocent \\\"first love\\\" kind of way, and only parted ways because I went to college and we were too young to do anything but move forward with our lives, it still hurt like hell. Should I have never loved him at all because I wasn't going to spend the rest of my life with him? Should I have never ventured out and opened my heart to the many men that came after him because I got hurt? Absolutely not. Had I done that, I never would have experienced the passionate, powerful, transformative love I shared with so many different people in my life, all of who made me the flawed, yet beautiful, and powerful woman I am today.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBrene Brown defines love as this, \\u003Cem\\u003E\\\"We cultivate love when we allow our most vulnerable and powerful selves to be deeply seen and known. When we honor the spiritual connection that grows from that offering with trust, respect, kindness and affection.\\\" \\u003C/em\\u003ELove isn't something we can give or get. It can only be cultivated and grown. That love won't be found by putting up walls and trying to protect ourselves from feeling any kind of pain and loss ever again. It has to be given to be received.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIt's now been a year and a half and I am learning to trust myself. That has taken a lot of work on my part and I have cried many tears getting there as the fear of opening myself up to getting hurt again sometimes engulfs me. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut when I need that little push to remind me of what's possible, I think of my dear friend, Mrs D, who lost her husband of over 40 years to lung cancer. Never have I seen a heart so broken or devastated, having lost the love of her life. She thought she would live the rest of her days alone and that was truly what she wanted, than to ever suffer the pain and loss of losing someone she loved again. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut 3 1/2 years later, she found another soulmate. She took a chance, opened herself up... and allowed herself to be vulnerable. And at 70 years old, is the happiest I've ever seen her.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIf there was every a reason to risk being vulnerable again, let her be an example of the beautiful payoff to taking that chance. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T14:27:41-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dina-strada/the-power-of-vulnerabilit_3_b_7508034.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dina-strada/the-power-of-vulnerabilit_3_b_7508034.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 21:27:41 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The Power of Vulnerability: Trusting Ourselves After Heartbreak"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 21:37:26 UTC +00:00]]

People want you to hurry up and get over it already! That or they're married and don't understand that it isn't a breakup -- it is a death when you lose your spouse. Your family, your dreams, your effort, your money --  you name it, you have lost it all. If only there was a proper burial to get through it and start to move on. Well, there isn't, but I did make this nifty little checklist in hopes to help other people grieving a divorce.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSigned,\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFrom the Trenches of Grief\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n•\\t\\u003Cem\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWatch your social media use\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/em\\u003E: You don't need to log on constantly to see photos of happy families, couples, people making babies and growing their families. Those things are the kiss of death to someone grieving a divorce. We think, \\\"Look at Jane and John! They look so happy! Why am I not happy? Why am I going through this?\\\" You start to viciously compare and feel terrible. Everyone on the planet is loved and you are not, except for that's probably just a myth.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n•\\t\\u003Cem\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EAllow yourself to feel like crap\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/em\\u003E: Don't let the crappy feelings tread on, but accept that right now you feel awful.

This isn't a legitimate list of steps you must do in order to finally feel happy again. Everyone grieves differently and for most of us, it's a roller coaster, although some people feel a steady stream of bad days only to move into continuous better days. For me, it's been a roller coaster and I am just now 15 months later entering the worst grieving period I have had, period.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n•\\t\\u003Cem\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EIf you divorced with children, consider this\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/em\\u003E: Did you meet someone and now you're dying to make a new family?

It's nice to have a family, but making up one very quickly with the goal of making it \\\"all better\\\" for you and your child/children is one that will backfire and hurt your kids. Take it easy and wait for introductions.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n•\\t\\u003Cem\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EMedication (or not...)\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/em\\u003E: I had a friend suggest medicating because I was sad for so long during the divorce process. I ignored that piece of advice. I am not pro-medication for myself and felt I needed to go through the emotions, no matter how tough. For others though, it's a worthwhile choice, especially if you're so depressed and cannot get out bed, eat, socialize, etc. It could be a temporary solution to get you through, although therapy in my opinion is an absolute must \\u003Cem\\u003Eif\\u003C/em\\u003E you can afford it. It's not something I have the ability to afford to do for the most part, so I touch base with a counselor as needed.  If you can, invest in yourself to get through the roughest few months and talk to someone.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n•\\t\\u003Cem\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EFind trench buddies\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/em\\u003E:  Find people who are going through divorce or have been through it and can help you.

Grieving is tough, and you may not always feel lovey dovey towards your ex, which is really only a problem if you have kids or interact. Either way though, if you're having a bad day and need to speak to your ex, keep it brief. Your hurt emotions and anger won't allow for happy conversation.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n•\\t\\u003Cem\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EExercise\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/em\\u003E: When in doubt, move.

Just be sure your pleasures don't turn into vices.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nGrieving a divorce can take six months for one person and six years for the other.

I was pregnant with identical twin boys in 2012, and they were born too early, living only a short time after a week-long, traumatic hospital stay and then horrific birth. In 2013, I made it to full-term with my perfectly healthy third son.

Goodness, I thought you were almost due!\\\" It's at these moments I wish my life looked like it should -- like it does in my head; a 5-year-old, two 3-year-olds and a nearly 2-year-old standing beside me.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI've learned to navigate my life story a little better in the past years, and to let go of some of the guilt. There are times I simply only have time to say, \\\"Thank you, we're excited as well.\\\" I chalk it up to telling someone, \\\"I'm fine!\\\" when your day really isn't going that well. Other conversations are harder -- comments about my body, the length of time between my daughter and this baby, or the fact that being sick (still) is \\\"What it takes for a healthy baby!\\\" In those moments, I often say the wrong thing, or say nothing at all. I'm trying to give myself grace to falter when it hurts.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nGrace for them, too. After all, who could guess my story? Who knows what to say when it spills out?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMotherhood is always going to be different. My anxiety, my worries -- all the ones that are brushed off as new mom fears have deep, painful roots for me. While we hope with all our hearts that our home will finally welcome a baby this fall, we also live with the reality of coming home empty-handed, packing up a life that wasn't ever started.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-04-1433436232-7306607-losingsons.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-06-04-1433436232-7306607-losingsons.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-04-1433436232-7306607-losingsons-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"570\\\" height=\\\"570\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMy motherhood is full of suffering -- my own and my children's, always on the verge of having to give back another desperately-wanted child.

I was scheduled to facilitate a discussion about academic leadership with colleagues around the state. I set my radio to C-SPAN and was soon listening to a morning call-in show. The host asked female listeners to share the policy issues that would matter most to them in the coming presidential election.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI listened for a while and heard a diverse group of women from around the country commenting from multiple perspectives about reproductive rights, environmental issues, immigration, health care, and more.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAfter listening for a while I pulled off the road to gas up and place my own call. When I had my opportunity to speak, I noted that one thing I will be watching for as I evaluate candidates will be their responses to women's issues. I said that as an educator I see many young women out-achieving their male counterparts in college, but finding themselves far behind them in terms of salaries and workplace influence five and 10 years later, and that I want to see leaders who do what they can to support environments that make it possible for both men and women to achieve and lead.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMy comments didn't spark any great response -- most callers wanted to either dispute something said by a previous caller or simply have their own ideas heard.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAs I continued to digest this conversation, I thought about the coming presidential election, and its relevance to the conversation I was anticipating with my colleagues. After reading many books and articles about leadership in times of change, I boiled key tenets of good leadership down to this list:\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n•\\tBe credible, transparent and reliable\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n•\\tBe honest as you assess yourself and others\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n•\\tRecognize and value differences in leadership styles\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n•\\tValue other kinds of difference as well\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n•\\tClarify goals/values/mission and align them with those of your organization\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n•\\tTake risks; be proactive and optimistic\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n•\\tBe open to unexpected opportunities\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n•\\tPay attention to interpersonal relationships\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n•\\tBe attentive to details or find and listen to someone who is\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n•\\tEmpower others to lead\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n•\\tListen to others\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n•\\tBe assertive when taking your own positions\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n•\\tManage conflict productively\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n•\\tTake responsibility for outcomes\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI realized that this list offers a good guide for evaluating candidates, and I made a decision to approach this election with this rubric in mind.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn the past I've ranged from being very actively involved in campaigning (including being a campaign precinct co-leader) to minimally involved (pretty much just voting on the day of the election).

She was alone, holding the cover to George Carlin's Class Clown LP, wheezing, not just because she suffered from industrial grade asthma, but because she had been laughing uncontrollably for a number of minutes.  I grabbed the cover from her, which was easy because she was weak from the hilarity. At the end of side two was the track, \\\"Seven Words You Can Never Say On Television.\\\" \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"What's that?\\\" I asked, pointing impudently to \\\"Seven Words.\\\"  She motioned vaguely at the speakers, indicating that that was what we were listening to.  At which point I heard - for the first time ever - the powerful and mysterious f-word (as well as some of the others cited by Mr. Carlin) in an electronic medium, and very possibly for the first time ever. When the needle hit the inner groove, I immediately slapped it down at the beginning of \\\"Seven Words\\\" again.  And again. And again. Everything we loved, we loved all the more with extreme repetition.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nNo adults burst in to save us from the horrors of this foul language, as we were pretty much running the show at the house by then, and Maryam was the ring-leader, the trailblazer and the Minister of Culture.  I had no idea how she knew of so many things outside of our little world, but I was in no position to question her sources, acolyte that I was. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThat December, Maryam decided that we should go see a new movie, Serpico, which featured a young Al Pacino.  It was rated R; Maryam was 15 and I had just turned 13.  If it had been up to me, an aspirant American Golden Boy, I would never have considered thumbing my nose at something as inviolable as the standards of the Motion Picture Association of America.  For Maryam, however, such an affront to the rules of civilization was \\u003Cem\\u003Ede rigeur.\\u003C/em\\u003E \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSerpico proved to be for me a riveting glimpse into realities I had only begun to suspect, particularly the truth that life is not fair.  I identified intensely with this brave and morally indefatigable cop, who confronted the systemic corruption of New York City's police force. Much as I had to confront the two-faced insincerity of some of my fellow seventh-graders. I developed, for a time, what Maryam told me was an excellent impression of Mr. Pacino's Serpico, which I relished performing -- usually for myself.  It felt deeply affirming to inhabit the character, as if I were then inculcated with the same bravery and charisma.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nInevitably, my impression would involve delivery of the f-word, which was used a mere 58 times in the movie (I counted).  Moderate, if not positively restrained, by today's standards. To my nearly virgin ears, however, it seemed to be fired off at every other word. Thus, my impression was liberally populated with this wondrous profanity, and my mouth quickly developed an enduring affection for forming the sounds that make the word up - the pneumatic menace of the \\\"f\\\", followed by nearly innocent vowels, slamming decisively into the precise, controlled violence of the hard \\\"k\\\" -- which has stayed with me to this graying day. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe saw Serpico six times that December (at least a couple of these were back to back screenings) completely high not on drugs, but on the drama.  Extreme, remorseless, rapturous repetition.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAdd to the physical satisfaction of the f-word's utterance the fact that it can be used to mean so many, many different things and what my 13-year old self had discovered was a word so attractively malleable that its incorporation into my day-to-day speech became inevitable. Why, to this very day, new uses of the word are revealed to me.  For instance, today if I say, \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/go-f**k-yourself-single/id999368054\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E\\\"go f*** yourself,\\\"\\u003C/a\\u003E  it is as likely as not that what I actually mean is  \\\"go, free yourself,\\\" or \\\"follow your bliss.\\\" \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSo it was that I, a prematurely large, somewhat gawky, reflexively conformist teenager, progressed into high school with a fanatical commitment to a strict interpretation of any code of conduct I could invoke to crush the human spirit, including the absolute necessity of sobriety (I wouldn't drink, let alone become a drunk until years later).  Follow the rules!  Fight corruption! - in all its insidious forms, in the hallways and gymnasiums throughout this...uh...midwestern farming community.  Yet, my tongue, once it had acquired the taste, never lost its love of the f-word.  Oh ye Puritans of filthy mouth, I am your brother.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nUnderneath the reflexive conformity lay, of course, the hopeless truth that I, Khalid Hanifi, was not of the midwestern world in which I found myself.  The proof was as plain as the name on my birth certificate. A figurative chip grew to a distracting size on my also figurative shoulder, manifested as what was described by my Latin teacher, Mr. Darnbarnacle (sadly, not his real name), as a \\\"bad attitude.\\\"  Which was a shame, really.  Because I actually did enjoy looking through the window into language that Latin, and its agent, Mr. Darnbarnacle had opened for me. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAs I was sitting in class one day, somewhere between affecting boredom and actually being bored, Mr. Darnbarnacle introduced the topic of verb conjugation, specifically the verb \\u003Cem\\u003EFacio\\u003C/em\\u003E.  \\u003Cem\\u003EFacio, Facere, Feci, Factus\\u003C/em\\u003E.  Meaning, as all with a passing familiarity with Latin know, to do, to make, to accomplish, and in the passive, to become.  Holy facio!  To do, to make.  What could be more clear?  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhile others certainly have performed an etymological analysis of \\u003Cem\\u003Efacio's\\u003C/em\\u003E connection to the f-word, I have never felt the need to look into it. It was and remains, for me, as obvious as the most obvious thing that was ever obvious. If I am merely indulging in linguistic solipsism and am utterly incorrect, please don't disabuse me of this, my most cherished teenage revelation.     \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAs earlier notions of propriety boil slowly away, and WTF, FOAD, FIIN, FFS, FIGMO, FISHDO, etc. \\u003Cem\\u003Ead nauseum\\u003C/em\\u003E, are lustily deployed at every textual opportunity, we seem to be at a point with our dear English language where the glacial prohibition against the f-word has nearly fully calved into the warming waters of acceptable speech.  Someday soon, perhaps, the FCC will officially render Mr. Carlin's list a complete anachronism.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe illicit thrill of uttering this former profanity would then no doubt diminish. In another 2000 years, for whatever people speaking whatever language may descend from present day English, provided of course humans still trundle about the earth, the f-word may simply mean an innocent hug. But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Time to slow down and just f***ing relax and enjoy using this glorious wildcard of a word.  Economically and in the proper context, of course. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://khalidhanifi.com/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EKhalid Hanifi's\\u003C/a\\u003E latest single, Go, F*** Yourself, is available wherever music is \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://khalidhanifi.bandcamp.com/track/go-fuck-yourself\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Esold\\u003C/a\\u003E or \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8phg4D80fMI\\u0026feature=youtu.be\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Estreamed\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003C/em\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T14:24:06-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/khalid-hanifi/a-latin-verb-corrupted-me_b_7498756.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/khalid-hanifi/a-latin-verb-corrupted-me_b_7498756.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 21:24:06 UTC +00:00], ["title", "A Latin Verb Corrupted Me"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 21:37:26 UTC +00:00]]

And the little plastic castle, is a surprise every time.\\\"\\u003C/em\\u003E -- Little Plastic Castles\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAs a rule, I generally don't give money to panhandlers. I donate food to a pantry and money to charitable foundations/causes, but I don't give directly to people. It's the age-old adage, the one about giving a man a fish vs. buying him cable so he can watch the fishing channel.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOr something like that.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhile in San Antonio, Texas, in line at a little Mexican restaurant, however, I did a 180 on my standard operating procedure.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI didn't know the city or the restaurant. I had been driving, saw the place, suddenly realized I hadn't eaten in seven hours, and pulled over. Wandering in and examining the overhead menu, I figured it was worth staying, so I got in line. Fairly soon after I arrived, a homeless man arrived and stood behind me. I didn't think anything of it, until he got out his money.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHe had one dollar.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOne dollar, and some change.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI saw him look at the menu, and then down at the change in his hand. As he counted through it -- the change in one palm and the index finger on his other hand shuffling through it for accuracy -- I was asked to order. I picked a $5 enchilada platter. I got out my wallet and paid, and then looked at the homeless man.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"Hey,\\\" I said. \\\"You got enough there to get what you need?\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHe was either startled or embarrassed, because he answered so quietly it was barely audible: \\\"I think so. Thank you.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI nodded and went and found a table to wait for my number to be called. The man collected a soda cup, filled it with iced tea and took a table on the other side of the restaurant.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMy number was shouted out. I went up to collect my food. While returning to my table, I heard a gentle voice say, \\\"Excuse me.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI turned to see the homeless man looking at me with sad eyes.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"Does your offer still stand?\\\" he asked politely.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"Absolutely,\\\" I said, reaching for my wallet.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"I was only thirsty when I ordered,\\\" he explained, \\\"but I should probably eat.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI gave him a couple bucks, he thanked me, and I returned to my table and stared at my food.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThough I had entered somewhat ravenous, I was immediately completely uninterested in my meal. I picked at it a little, then decided I had to leave; I no longer felt like eating. I didn't want to be there, I wasn't hungry, and something was wrong inside me.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI got up and walked my tray over to his table, and where I had ordered the enchilada platter he had a simple, small bowl of Spanish rice in front of him. It was without doubt the cheapest item on the menu.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI set my tray down, \\\"I didn't really touch this,\\\" I said. \\\"I filled up pretty quickly.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHe looked up at me with his sad eyes, thanked me with his shy, soft voice, and I left.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI got into my car, pulled out my expensive and seemingly self-indulgent smart phone, and emailed my wife. I told her what happened, and that for reasons I didn't understand, I felt awful. She did her best to cheer me up, her warm words filling a cold screen, trying to assuage my first-world guilt.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSafe in the cocoon of my car, reading, \\\"Why do you feel bad? You did a good thing!\\\" I teared up and began to cry. It wasn't sobbing; the tears just trickled out of me, an uncontrolled sadness doing its best to escape my guilt-ridden body.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI don't really know why I felt so horrible, but the thoughts going through my head were: Should I have just offered to pay for his lunch while I was paying for mine? Did I give him enough money? What was he going to do for dinner?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EWhy didn't I do more?\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe last question haunted me.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI didn't know anything about this man, or his history. He may have hurt his wife and kids at one time; he may have had a great job but abused alcohol or drugs and wasted away his fortunes and talents. I had no clue, and I didn't care. In the moment I saw him, in that one moment he was counting the change in his hand to see if he could afford to feed himself, all I saw was a fragile human in need. A man searching for the most basic of all needs: sustenance. And that moment hit me in places I don't like to admit exist.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMy tears only lasted about 20 seconds, and a mere 10 minutes later I was swearing at my GPS for taking me to a residential neighborhood and telling me I was at the location of a car wash I was looking for.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYou have moments in life that reach the core of who you are supposed to be and how you are supposed to think, and then they fade.

One of my friends (let's call him Dumbo) was shooting pool and really savoring the game -- even though there were a few people waiting their turn for a table.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThis big biker guy (let's call him Biker) was really getting annoyed that Dumbo was taking his sweet time. Biker was hovering over the table and started to snort (loudly) every time Dumbo missed a shot.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThen there was a moment -- a moment when Biker's patience ran out. His body language tightened, there was a crackling in the air and I knew it was not going to end well. I walked over to my friend Dumbo and whispered to him, \\\"Dumbo, I'm pretty sure if you don't wrap this game up quickly, you are going to get punched in the face.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHe looked at me and laughed, waved me off and said I was \\\"overreacting\\\" and my \\\"body language instinct\\\"' were \\u003Cem\\u003EWAY\\u003C/em\\u003E off.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nDumbo was being pretty obnoxious, so I decided to let it go; a punch in the face might do him some good.

Jaw Thrust\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAlso known as a chin jut or a jaw clench, this is when someone grits their teeth and then shoves their jaw out in your direction. When we are feeling angry we naturally grit our teeth--sometimes to control an emotional outburst and sometimes out of pure frustration. This is also a territorial gesture. When someone chin juts at you they are threatening your space with theirs. It's a nonverbal way of saying, \\\"Back up!\\\" Another reason the jaw thrust is confrontational is because it forces the person to look down their nose at you which is a very standoffish gesture. Look at these three pictures:\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-01-1433199320-9416748-ScreenShot20150320at2.48.28PM.png\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-06-01-1433199320-9416748-ScreenShot20150320at2.48.28PM.png\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-01-1433199320-9416748-ScreenShot20150320at2.48.28PM-thumb.png\\\" width=\\\"570\\\" height=\\\"237\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe 1st one is neutral.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe 2nd one with the chin jut is the one that should irritate you the most.

Nostril Flaring\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nA nostril flare is when we fan out the outer lobes of our nose so they are as wide as possible. It's sometimes called 'wing dilation'. Flaring our nostrils before a fight is a very important survival mechanism, because when we open up our nostrils we are able to take in more oxygen. This fills up our lungs and loads our blood with oxygen so we have the energy to fight. It is possible our nostrils flare before a fight to take in more of the opponent's smell as some experts think we can subconsciously smell adrenaline and pheromones. Before a fight it is good to know as much about your opponent as possible.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cul\\u003E\\u003Cli\\u003EContext is important here: nostril flaring can also happen during \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.chasehughes.com/attraction-signals.html\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Earousal and attraction\\u003C/a\\u003E.

Chest Puff\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBefore getting into a fight our bodies want to get as big as possible. This happens for 2 reasons. First, when we are bigger we look more imposing to our opponent--and could possibly scare them off. Second, the more space our bodies take up, the more testosterone we produce. According to \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/9547823/13-027.pdf?sequence=1\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EAmy Cuddy at Harvard Business School\\u003C/a\\u003E, testosterone (for both men and women) is the strength hormone. It not only makes us perform better and think faster, but it also makes us feel more confident--essential for winning a fight. So someone who is about to act out with violence will often puff out their chest and hold their head high to look as big as possible.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ciframe src=\\\"https://embed-ssl.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are.html\\\" width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen\\u003E\\u003C/iframe\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cul\\u003E\\u003Cli\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EDe-escalation\\u003C/strong\\u003E: Don't cower. While you don't want to puff up like them (this challenges them), you don't want to cower either. This will not only make you feel worse, but it might encourage them to see you as a weak opponent. You are much better off standing your ground and holding your hands out and open with your palms up. This is the universal 'non-threatening' gesture and signals to them you don't want to fight.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\u003C/ul\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E4.

When we are \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/eye-opener-why-do-pupils-dialate/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Eunder stress\\u003C/a\\u003E our brain goes into fight, flight or freeze mode where it needs to assess the environment incredibly quickly to decide what to do next. If someone is feeling threatened and is considering getting violent with you, their pupils expand to take in as much of the surroundings as possible--do you have friends with you, could you be carrying a weapon, what's the escape route? This might even be happening totally subconsciously, but you can be aware of this subtle change to predict aggression.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYet again, pupil dilation also happens during arousal. Specifically when men see a naked woman or when either sex is in orgasm. Why? Our eyes want to take in as much of a good thing as possible. Again if you take off your clothes in front of a man and his pupils dilate, it's a good thing.

In other words, instead of facing someone front on, you pull your leg and shoulder back so the opponent can only see and access the side of the body.

The way the body does this is by creating a muscular armor around soft tissue. Have you ever seen those videos of magicians getting punched in the stomach? They are able to do this by clenching their stomach muscles which protect the sensitive intestines. When someone's entire body tenses up they are protecting their vitals and getting increased blood flow to their limbs in order to fight or flight faster.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cul\\u003E\\u003Cli\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003ESpecial Note\\u003C/strong\\u003E: Clenching fists is another type of tightening that happens around anger.

When people are suspicious (or at best intensely curious) their ocular orbitals will tighten. You might think of this as a glare or 'narrowing your eyes' at someone.

As I made my way around town, I noticed the homeless near grocery stores, in the parks and by the beach. I have always wondered what life must be like for human beings to wander city streets all day long; their entire lives packed in a shopping cart, in a garbage bag, or an old pull-along case. Where did they go, what did they eat and, most importantly, what was going on in their minds? Our neighbors living on the street, starving emotionally and physically in the midst of abundance! \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMost of us appreciate a kind word or a smile. The only way to experience equanimity is directly related to have love and compassion for all. With this in mind, I made an effort to talk to some of the homeless. Like most people, some were open to a conversation while others remained silent. The ones who did speak, talked about the degradation of living on the streets, in the rain,  the cold, and spending many days without a single morsel of food. Contrary to a popular assumption that all homeless people are pan handling nuisances, most declined my attempts to hand them a couple of dollars. In essence, it felt that a single drop of kindness had created an ocean of gratitude in the hearts and minds of these disadvantaged people.   \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nToo often, some of us ignore the reality of homelessness in this country or look upon these ragged souls with disdain. I have heard people say, \\\"Let them get a job like everyone else.  We shouldn't enable their laziness by giving hand-outs;\\\" or \\\"we are just weakening them further by giving them money or food;\\\" \\\"he/she is probably a drug addict or alcoholic, why throw our good money for their addictions.\\\" I am not negating these misgivings completely, however, what if some of these assumptions are not real?  When in doubt, do what feels right. In that spirit, I venture out a couple of times a week with the intention to find at least one homeless person to offer a small gesture of kindness.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nA few months ago, I set out to find at least one such person. I did not find anyone. I needed something from the grocery store. Inside the store, a lady approached me and asked if I had fifty cents. I wasn't quite sure for what she needed the change. She told me she was going to buy a bag of chips since she hadn't had anything to eat that day. I offered her a sandwich from the deli instead. She accepted gladly. I sat down with her, with the intention of finding out if I could help her buy food on a weekly basis. She told me she had been homeless for two months, but she was not completely discouraged. She believed that being on the street was safer for her since there were some serious problems in her family. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe made arrangements to meet once a week at the store and I would give her enough money to buy her basic necessities for the following week. What I found most amazing was this lady's unwavering faith in God. She was convinced that she would not remain in this condition for long, and God will come through for her sooner than later. During the following weeks, she got a small job working for some charitable agency, but going to work from the street was posing a major difficulty for her. I did see her  for about eight months every week while she was homeless. Last week when I saw her,  she was overjoyed to let me know that Social Services had arranged for her to rent an apartment. She would no longer find it difficult to report for work when she gets a job. A happy ending for one life! \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nCompassion for those less fortunate than us, is our ability to think about our own physical and emotional needs, and then transpose them in thinking that the rest of humanity has the same basic needs. Most of us are hugely blessed to not only meet our basic needs, but to have fantastic lifestyles. This does not diminish our need to see and the need to look around us, we must listen as well as hear. Compassion is free and cannot be realized unless we love for others what we desire for ourselves. Compassion will find its own path, set its' own pace and travel ahead in its' own way. True and sincere compassion does not need any recognition, its' effects bounce back into our lives in ways, which defy any logical explanations. At least this has been my personal experience. In all respects, keep giving respect to everyone you encounter in life. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T14:36:41-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-hyder-zahed/right-outside-our-doors_b_7507372.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-hyder-zahed/right-outside-our-doors_b_7507372.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 21:36:41 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Right Outside Our Doors!"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 21:59:11 UTC +00:00]]

They both sound appealing, but are obviously quite different. How do you know which option to choose?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EKey Pieces of Information\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe key to almost all credit card offers boils down to four things. First is the APR. If that APR is a special introductory rate, then the second bit of information you need to know is when that intro rate expires. Unless you plan on paying off the entire balance before the offer expires, then the third thing you will want to know is what the APR will be after the introductory offer expires. The fourth piece of data is anything that represents an additional expense to you, such as an annual fee or a balance transfer fee.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EKeep Calculations Simple\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThese things can be confusing because the length of the discounted APR rate is not the same, and neither is the amount of the transfer fee. To make it easier to compare both offers, reduce them to terms that can be viewed side-by-side. A shortcut to help with that is to convert the APR to a monthly number or cost.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nStart by simply rounding numbers. Let's say the balance carried on the card is $1,000. If the APR is 10%, that means you will pay approximately 10% of your $1,000 balance in interest each year. That comes to $100 annually.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nNext, you need to divide that number by 12, which will give you a rough idea of how much the interest charges are costing you per month. $100 divided by 12 = $8.30.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cul\\u003E\\u003Cli\\u003EIf the APR is 4.99%, just round it up to 5%. That will give you50 per year in interest; roughly4 per month.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003EFor an APR of 2.99% you can round up to 3% - which gives you30 a year or2.50 per month.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\u003C/ul\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn this way, you can simplify any APR to a ballpark estimate of how much interest it will cost you per month to carry a $1,000 balance. Since you also know the approximate monthly charges you can multiply that by how many months the introductory rate is offered for.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EDon't Miss the Expiration\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIf you were comparing 0% for 18 months to 4.99% for 24 months, for instance, you would then know that at 4.99%, you'll wind up paying somewhere around $4 a month for 24 months or a total of about $96 in interest.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWith the 0% offer there is a 3% surcharge, so to do a balance transfer of $1,000 would cost $30 ($1,000 X 3% = $30). That means that even after paying the surcharge you'll wind up paying about $66 dollars less with the 0% offer ($96-$30 = $66). That makes it look like the 0% offer is cheaper, but we cannot forget that the 0% expires six months sooner than the 4.99% offer which lasts for 24 months.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nTo factor that in and compare both offers over the full 24 months, find out what the APR will be after the 0% introductory rate expires. For example, if the on-going interest rate 15.99% after the introductory period, that means you'll be charged 15.99% for six months. Round the interest rate up to 16% to calculate the approximate APR, and divide by 12 months to get the monthly cost.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cul\\u003E\\u003Cli\\u003E$1,000 X 16% =160 a year or about13 a month. Now you know that paying the higher rate for six months will tack on approximately78 extra dollars in interest (13 X 6 =78).\\u003C/li\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003EComparing the offers with this extra information we see that the 0% is actually the more expensive option over 24 months, because it will wind up costing you78 plus a30 surcharge. That's a total of116 versus just96 with the 4.99% offer.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\u003C/ul\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe key is to pay off your balance before the introductory rate expires. If you think you can pay it off within 18 months, then using our example, the total charges for the 0% 18-month offer will only be the $30 surcharge. If you need 24 months to pay if off, though, then the 4.99% offer will save you more - as long as you pay off that balance before it expires.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EInstant Calculations\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSometimes pictures and charts can lay it all out in a visual way that is easier to understand.

She would add a bit of sawdust to pep the charcoal up and an all-knowing smile would engulf her face.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI never imagined in my life that the magic of a simple act by my grand mom from a south Indian village could one day profoundly impact a commercial plant operation on other side of the world. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EConnecting the Dots\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nA few years ago, I was back in the office after a vacation. I was doing my rounds catching up with folks. I was about to cross the office of a seasoned executive. I did not have a business reason to enter his office. I entered anyway. He had a positive aura around him. Every time I entered, I always felt more positive and better by the time I left his office. I called him Mr. Positive Energy. As always, he was seated at his desk, looked up and welcomed me with his warm smile. After some pleasantries and chit-chat, I asked him what was the most pressing issue he was working on. A power plant was built sitting on top of a coal source. The way he explained it to me -- they dug the coal from underneath -- it was like layers of sponge cake with coal and clay mixed up, held together by water. The wetness of the coal/ clay combination created problems for the conveyor belt system that moved the coal while it dried. There was substantial caking -- similar to dried up clay on a jeep wheel that had visited rugged terrain. He added -- \\\"The plant folks are exploring solutions.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI asked him whether they have considered keeping the conveyor belt wet at all times, he said they have but that keeps the coal moist, reducing efficiency. Casually, without too much thought, I suggested that they look into sawdust. The engineer in him brightened up, his eye popped, he added, \\\"it is elegantly simple - flammable product and a water absorbent.\\\"   He immediately made a call to his plant manager. When he put the phone down, he mentioned with his ever beaming smile -- looks like we will have a wood crusher mobilized. He gave me a pat on the back and said, \\\"this is going to be a game changer for this multimillion dollar plant.\\\" \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe next time I met Mr. Positive Energy, he was beaming again. He shared the success story at the plant and gave me credit for chipping in. While he was speaking, I was left wondering how much it would have meant to me to share it with my grandmother who passed away a few years before then.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ETribute and the Bigger Impact \\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EIf connecting dots inspires innovations, this contribution of my grandmother from a village in India impacting a massive plant in America would be cherished among the top in my life.\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe vagaries of life bring wows and wonders in great measure and it has given me immense pleasure to grab the opportunity to share it with the world - a tribute to my mom's mom, one of the most brilliant soul I had the privilege to meet in my lifetime. \\u003Cstrong\\u003EHer abilities constrained by the times she was born- all she could complete was 4th grade. Yet, she marshaled immense pleasure in what life offered her - keeping her family well fed and yet grilling in us an insatiable hunger for more - knowledge for the most meaningful and simple things in life.\\u003C/strong\\u003E I owe a lot to her - writing my first alphabets with chalk on her kitchen floor, summer/winter vacation stories from mythologies and many more. In the belief that it is better late than never, I am leaning in to salute my grand mom and her memories - a woman ahead of her times in spirit. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T14:30:52-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karthik-rajan/how-my-grand-mother-impac_b_7507962.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karthik-rajan/how-my-grand-mother-impac_b_7507962.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 21:30:52 UTC +00:00], ["title", "How My Grandmother Impacted a Multimillion Dollar American Plant's Success?

And yet, in the race for the White House, these are the two candidates whose voices and platforms are the best-developed to date.  The dozen others whose party affiliations are not in question, Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush as examples, are struggling to provide us their blueprints.  By degrees, their promises are predictable and party-compliant as also evidenced by the official campaign starts of \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/01/politics/lindsey-graham-presidential-announcement-election-2016/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ELindsey Graham\\u003C/a\\u003E, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/30/politics/martin-omalley-2016-presidential-announcement/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EMartin O'Malley\\u003C/a\\u003E and \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/27/politics/rick-santorum-2016-presidential-announcement/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ERick Santorum\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHow we've come to this point is a question for historians and wonks.

Most called it electoral theatre. Paul called it principled -- the preservation of constitutional freedoms.  His chamber maneuver was a Jam, the strategy of sabotage.  His explanation was a Recast, the play that morphs one narrative into another.  But with a roiling Middle East and Republican preferences for security over privacy, Paul's free-market, low-intervention policies took him down, perhaps fatally in the polls.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBy most accounts, Bernie Sanders' odds are even longer.  Still, he's started strong, in many ways due to his mastery of freezing plays, influence strategies that inhibit rival movements and motivations.  \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/is-bernie-sanders-really-a-pot-smoking-socialist/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EResponding\\u003C/a\\u003E to questions about smoking pot, he admitted he did.

His play was the Disco, the strategy that salvages a losing hand and repositions the player for success.  Sanders strain of politics is what he describes as democratic socialism, a flip made possible by Paul's favored Recast.  This might barely salve skeptical D's so he'll need a better story if, by some accident of history, he wins the nomination.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhat each candidate is competing for (and against) is trust. They are and will be portrayed by mainstream party candidates as devils.  Paul will be targeted with Call Outs and Mirrors, claims that he's a conservative turncoat and a global coward.

But she’s not the only one with her hat in the ring.

Ryan's message: The bill “empowers” lawmakers and “brings more accountability, and transparency.”\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n“That is effectively the message I am giving to our members, and I think it’s a very convincing argument,” he said on Thursday.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nGaining fast-track power from Congress is critical to Obama’s agenda, and to the White House's ongoing negotiations with 11 Pacific countries attempting to seal the deal on a major trade agreement known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSpeaking Thursday to a packed room of at least 30 reporters, Ryan exuded confidence.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n“I feel very good,” he said. “Two years ago, I said we were going to need 50 Democrats to get this done. We won’t need that anymore. We are still going to need the president to deliver votes, and more than they have right now... But candidly, I have never been as confident about it as I am right now.”\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIt’s a bold statement ahead of what is expected to be a long and grueling debate over trade in the House this month. Ryan’s comments came hours after House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said she thinks Republicans will need the cooperation of \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/04/pelosi-trade-bill_n_7512122.html?utm_hp_ref=politics\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Eat least 200 members\\u003C/a\\u003E of their own party to get fast-track across the finish line. Pelosi added that it’s not her responsibility to help Obama out.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe TPP debate has turned into one of the rare occasions where Obama is facing off against his own party -- even against Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), the party's leaders in Congress who are usually the president's most stalwart partners when it comes to advancing his agenda.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nRyan and other GOP leaders have had to move delicately in courting other members of their party, just as Obama has had to proceed with caution while targeting Democrats.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n“Having someone from the Obama administration call [Republicans] isn’t particularly helpful,\\\" said Ryan on Thursday. \\\"It’s basically us talking to them.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nRyan added that Obama is “working the phones pretty hard,” judging by the number of Democrats who have told Ryan the president has reached out to them.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut Democratic leadership in the House isn’t lending a hand to the effort, as a majority of the party is vehemently opposed to fast-track and trade deals. Democrats argue that such measures hurt American workers and create opportunities for environmental and human rights abuses.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n“It is a very large number in our caucus that is not supportive” of fast-track, Pelosi said.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nRyan, for his part, said he isn’t trying to court Democrats, instead leaving that up to Obama -- though the task presents a heavy burden for White House officials.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n“We are basically depending upon the president to deliver the votes he needs to deliver,” Ryan said Thursday, though he added that the trade bill would not be brought to the floor unless Republicans knew they would have the votes to pass it.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe most recent estimate The Huffington Post has heard, provided two weeks ago by one member of Congress, put Republican votes at 170. But Ryan's confidence this week suggests that number may have gone up.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOn Wednesday, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/06/03/white-house-makes-trade-pitch-with-focus-on-moderates/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EThe Wall Street Journal reported\\u003C/a\\u003E that Obama had told Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), vice chair of the New Democrat Coalition, that he has 20 Democratic votes in his pocket.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nUltimately, the vote is expected to be close, and policy issues will likely bog down the debate even further.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAt issue for Democrats is the Medicare offset included in the trade adjustment assistance bill, intended to help U.S. workers displaced by jobs lost to trade deals. Democrats want another option that will pay for the assistance, not cuts to Medicare.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nRyan said Thursday that Republicans are willing to give Democrats what they want on trade adjustment assistance.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n“We are open to changing the offset. This is something that I’ve always been open to changing if it’s felt to be necessary,\\\" he said. \\\"How and where, when we make a decision, I’ll let you know.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nRyan also needs to resolve the issue of certain language included in the Senate-passed bill that blocks countries marked with a \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/30/malaysia-slavery-trade_n_7472682.html?utm_hp_ref=politics\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ETier 3 designation on human trafficking\\u003C/a\\u003E -- the worst marker a nation can receive from the State Department -- from entering trade deals with the U.S.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThat poses a problem for Obama’s work on the TPP, where one of the 12 countries hoping to be included is \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/26/tpp-malaysia-slavery_n_7444978.html?utm_hp_ref=politics\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EMalaysia\\u003C/a\\u003E -- a Tier 3 offender on human trafficking.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFixing that would involve putting some modified language in a customs trade enforcement bill that's expected to go to conference between the Senate and the House.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n“We are pretty much in agreement on about 85 percent of that bill, so I do not foresee a very long conference whatsoever,” Ryan said.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHe added that the modified language -- which would allow Tier 3 countries to participate in trade deals like the TPP as long as they make concrete plans to rectify their modern-day slavery problem -- was approved by Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the author of the original measure, as well as by other lawmakers.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n“We think it’s important to stand against human trafficking and the compromise worked out... [It's] something that outside groups think is good language. We have already agreed to put that in conference in the customs bill,” said Ryan.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut in \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://cdn.rollcall.com/news/dont_reward_human_traffickers-242110-1.html\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Ean op-ed for Roll Call\\u003C/a\\u003E earlier this week, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/01/menendez-trade-slavery_n_7487312.html?utm_hp_ref=politics\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EMenendez shifted\\u003C/a\\u003E, warning the House not to “strip or change” the stronger language passed in the Senate bill. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nRyan advised Menendez to “take yes for an answer” because the House would be “putting his [new] language in the customs bill.”\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhen pressed on Malaysia’s slavery record, and his view that U.S. leadership on trade boils down to a “moral authority issue,” Ryan said the Senate's version of the trafficking language would have hurt other countries.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n“Don’t harm other countries we are trying to deal with -- Japan, Canada, Australia -- because of Malaysia’s problems... We shouldn’t confer Malaysia’s sins to these other countries we are trying to get agreements with.

As is, too many L.A. residents take a saw to street trees they view as a nuisance.

I'm a stepmom. My kids have a stepmom. I think this puts me on all sides of the stepmom issue.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThough our all-American blended family can be confusing, it's a giant family filled with people who love all of the children involved. Through the years of being on one side or the other or both, I've learned several valuable lessons.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E1. No one can ever nor should they ever try to replace the mother/child relationship.\\u003C/strong\\u003E  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThis is the most important lesson there is.  In my situation, my daughters' stepmom has no biological children. My stepdaughter's biological mom has two other kids from another relationship, but my stepdaughter is her only daughter.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI have three daughters, so my stepdaughter is a bonus daughter. She currently loves all things girly, so I finally get to put my braiding skills to good use!  Just because I love the time I spend with her dressing as princesses, doing manicures, and doing her hair doesn't mean I'm trying to take over as her mom. It means I thoroughly enjoy our time together and want to make the most of it.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWith that said, if she ever feels uncomfortable, she tells me. She has said that she wants her mom to do her nails for big holidays, and that is just fine with me.  Just as I want my daughters' wishes respected by their stepmom, I respect my stepdaughter's wishes. No one can replace me as their mom and I certainly would never want to replace my stepdaughter's mom.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E2. Being a stepmom is a huge undertaking.\\u003C/strong\\u003E  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nTry watching \\u003Cem\\u003ECinderella\\u003C/em\\u003E with your child once and not catch the evil stepmother plot line.  It doesn't just exist in \\u003Cem\\u003ECinderella\\u003C/em\\u003E, either. There's a stigma associated with being a stepmom. Many people think you're trying to take over the biological mom's role, especially the biological mom (see lesson 3).  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMany believe that no child loves their stepparent. Though that isn't reality in many, many cases, it is still a huge transition for all involved and the stepmom's feelings through that transition are last on the list -- as it should be.  The transition needs to work for the children involved, not the stepmom involved.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe're there to love and support our stepchildren as much as the biological parents. We're not there to take over, but we are there to offer additional love and support. Being a mom is hard enough because we handle a lot of the emotional needs of the family. When you're a stepmom, it's a thin line between overstepping bounds and being what the kids need you to be: loving, unconditional support.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E3. There is enough love to go around.\\u003C/strong\\u003E  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMoms are very protective of their children. My daughters will tell you that they can see me starting to go \\\"Mama Bear\\\" on anyone who messes with them (it's not pretty). When another woman comes into the lives of our children, it's hard not to feel that twang of jealousy and anxiety about whether or not the kids will like her more, not to mention worrying about how they'll be treated. That's part of what makes us the incredible, emotional beings that we are.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThis lesson is the hardest to learn. There is enough love for moms, stepmoms, stepdads, dads, grandparents, aunts, uncles and everyone else.  Just as our hearts grow when we have more children, our children's hearts grow when they gain bonus parents.  It's not always quick or easy, but it can happen with the right support.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThough bringing a stepparent into the picture is a huge transition, one of the benefits is that it can show the kids that they are loved by many and in many different ways. Everyone in the family will have different strengths and those strengths can all come in handy to help raise the children involved.  Embracing a new stepparent can be a long process for all involved, but can also result in some of the most rewarding relationships for these kids. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T15:14:48-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-becker/3-lessons-ive-learned-being-stepmom_b_7513622.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-becker/3-lessons-ive-learned-being-stepmom_b_7513622.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 22:14:48 UTC +00:00], ["title", "3 Lessons I've Learned From Being on Both Sides of the Stepmom Issue"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 22:24:27 UTC +00:00]]

But the humor is directed at a misperception that is not so funny.  With our society's superficial focus on youth and appearance, we have emphasized all the wrong reasons for maintaining a healthy body weight, which has nothing to do with \\\"catching dick.\\\"  We are sold the idea that remaining slim is primarily important as a means of attracting the opposite sex, rather than as a path to good health and longevity.  That inherent and unquestioned assumption about our motivations for weight loss is why Schumer's line is in fact so humorous.

Christie openly acknowledges that he struggles with his weight, but claimed that he is \\\"remarkably healthy.\\\"  Well, no.  The Governor said that unless Mariano gave him a physical exam or learned his family history, she could make no judgment about his health.  He is wrong, because any casual observer can see that Christie is obese, as he would himself admit - and the reality is that obesity is known to lead to an increased risk for premature death.  Here is an easy bottom line worth remembering:  \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.wvdhhr.org/bph/oehp/obesity/mortality.htm\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Eone in five deaths\\u003C/a\\u003E is \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.mailman.columbia.edu/news/obesity-kills-more-americans-previously-thought\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Elinked\\u003C/a\\u003E to excess weight.  Most Americans die sooner than necessary by stroke, heart attack or cancer -- and obesity increases the risk for all of these.  Christie should remember that the Titanic was a healthy ship just before hitting the iceberg.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe know absolutely that obesity creates an increased \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://utweightloss.com/comorbid.asp\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Erisk of diabetes\\u003C/a\\u003E. In 1990 about 11 million Americans had type 2 adult onset diabetes, a disease of insulin resistance that commonly coexists with obesity; just nine years later the number was 16 million, or about 6% of all Americans. Then from 1999 to 2003 we saw a 41% increase in diagnosed diabetes. Since then obesity has ballooned to an astounding 64% of all Americans and the number of diabetics \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.altfutures.org/pubs/diabetes2025/US_Diabetes2025_Overall_BriefingPaper_2011.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Econtinues to explode\\u003C/a\\u003E.

The human body evolved from a period of deprivation where food was scarce and difficult to obtain. Our ancestors were almost certainly lean. In any case, we are not engineered to bear excess weight on our joints. Obesity leads to arthritis - and often to joint replacement not only because of the mechanical stress it can cause but because fat produces chemicals that attack cartilage. Think of it this way: If you stuff 20 people into a VW Bug, the suspension will wear out faster and the engine will have to work harder, ultimately reducing its useful life.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOne final consideration on the idea of being fat but fit: obesity affects quality of life through limited mobility, decreased physical endurance, and social, academic and job discrimination.

The sea is the background of my whole life. I was lucky enough to serve as a European marine commissioner at a very critical period for European seas and oceans. I was able to introduce a new sustainable fisheries policy and the blue growth agenda. And all this thanks to the support of concerned citizens and conservation NGOs.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSo the conservation world was very familiar and challenging for me after ending my European mandate. And TNC was my choice as a global opportunity because of its huge capacity, but mainly as an opportunity for action. You--we--at TNC are great doers. So ideas and tangible results drew me here. This is the best!\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ETercek: \\u003C/strong\\u003EWhat are the biggest threats to our oceans?

Human activity can also be the best opportunity for healthy seas and happy people if regulated, controlled and inspired by sustainability. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ETercek: At this week's World Ocean Summit, we're hearing a lot about the blue economy and blue growth. How would you describe those in layman's terms?  \\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EDamanaki:\\u003C/strong\\u003E Some years ago, these terms were completely unknown. They're becoming familiar to our ears as humanity is turning to the oceans for food, energy, transport, leisure and supplies. We are rapidly exhausting land resources--now oceans are the next target. I hope that now human beings are wiser to avoid the mistakes of the past. Blue growth--development in the oceans--is happening anyway. It has come to stay because it corresponds to human needs. Blue Growth by Design is TNC's target. It brings the conservation voice loud and clear to this reality. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ETercek: \\tWhat major takeaways do you expect from the summit?

I expect the big takeaway of this summit will be the emerging alliance between public authorities, corporations with sustainable practices and NGOs for promoting sustainability.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHealthy oceans and investments for growth and jobs can coexist. This is a sign of hope for the coastal areas and marine zones where much ocean development has already happened, and for the 64 percent of the ocean that is beyond national jurisdiction, in a complete limbo of governance. At least we know more about the problem now. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ETercek: Give us an example of sustainable blue growth in action.\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EDamanaki: \\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://coastalresilience.org/project-areas/grenada-st-vincent-and-the-grenadines-introduction/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EOur work in Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\\u003C/a\\u003E in the Eastern Caribbean is a good example.

I'm happy that you, the TNC president, are raising the issue. I think that we at TNC have to be more open to the outer world. No doubt that we have the size and the capacity to change a lot. But we also have to be willing to allow our own change. Resistance to change is the big enemy for the big and strong. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ETercek: I admired your leadership as European Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries.

When I took office, only five fish stocks were fished sustainably--now we have almost 30.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIf I had the opportunity to do it again, I would have established my alliances from the first year--alliances with the conservation world but also with international partners like the governments of the U.S., Japan, China and Australia. I had the illusion that the European Union was strong enough to deliver changes. But the deep sea fish problem is still there. I failed to tackle it. Europe was too small for it. I recognized that during the second year of my mandate. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe ocean is bigger than all of us. Nobody can work alone on it.

I was lucky enough to be at the right place at the right moment and have hundreds of young people doing the same. I was not acting alone. That's why we were successful, though we had to pay a hard price in exile or prison. These difficult times gave us a good lesson: to be patient about big changes. They have their own pace, so if you are not going against nature, history and common good, then sooner or later, good things will come.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EMark Tercek is the president and CEO of the Nature Conservancy and author of \\u003Cem\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://marktercek.com\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ENature's Fortune: How Business and Society Thrive by Investing in Nature\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/em\\u003E Follow Mark on Twitter \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MarkTercek\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E@MarkTercek\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n[Images: The Nature Conservancy is restoring healthy coral reefs in Florida's Dry Tortugas National Park © Carlton Ward; Maria Damanaki © The Nature Conservancy]\\u003C/em\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T15:12:32-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-tercek/sustainable-ocean-develop_b_7515022.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-tercek/sustainable-ocean-develop_b_7515022.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 22:12:32 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Sustainable Ocean Development is Possible: Q&A with Maria Damanaki"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 22:24:27 UTC +00:00]]

The culture shock is something he is still adjusting to as my spouse, and understandably so. I remember the day I told him that he is expected to offer a dowry to take my hand in marriage. To this day, he talks about that moment and laughs.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut these things, although odd to others, are a part of what makes us unique. The act of offering a dowry to my parents has nothing really to do with a price being placed on a woman, but is a sign of respect and way of saying that I am prepared to not only marry your daughter, but to take care of her and my future children.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nRespect is a huge part of who we are, and it is so instilled in us that even as an adult, I am still learning to have difficult conversations with my parents. This does not account for the fact that I am also the daughter of a pastor and missionary.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI did not date in high school. Instead, I focused on academics and extra-curricular activities.  My mother made sure I remained as busy as possible, in order to avoid unnecessary distractions. To say that I was the last person that anyone in my family expected to come home pregnant was an understatement, but even more than that, I was the last person that \\u003Cem\\u003EI\\u003C/em\\u003E expected to come home pregnant. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe shame was unbearable. I was not only the pastor's daughter, but a Sunday School teacher, with two younger sisters looking up to me. The experience, although unbearable at the time, has taught me a lot about myself, and I am ready to share my experience with other young women who may have or are going through the same thing today.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EMistakes are an opportunity to learn just how capable you are.

I have since gone on to launch a great business, start a blog and write for some of my favorite publications. My mistakes have only empowered me and reminded me of what I am truly capable of not only as a woman of faith, but as a mother.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ENever judge, because anyone is capable of making mistakes.\\u003C/strong\\u003E  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYes! I was one of those girls who looked down on teenage moms and women in the church who had children out of wedlock. I couldn't imagine what on earth could convince someone to make such a stupid and embarrassing mistake. I was sure that I would remain a virgin until marriage, and no one was going to convince me to drop my pants before putting a ring on my finger before my parents, the church and my God.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnd yet, I allowed myself to do just that, because I did not want to be a \\\"tease.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI swear I still cringe when I think about that day, the moment and the decision that changed my life forever.

Instead, I find myself passionate today about the struggles that young black women endure, the need to help them to understand that one mistake should never be the end of your dreams, future or life.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"Your gifts will make room for you\\\" is something I was taught in church. I have heard this biblical passage repeated for as long as I can remember, but it wasn't until I became a mother that  I really understood what that meant.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBeing resourceful and creative is something that has always been a strength of mine. I never went more than a few days without some sort of a means of making an income, because I knew how to find a way to make money. Although my family helped me in ways I could never repay, I found a way to remain productive as a mother. I made sure that I always had the money to help my mother in any way that I could, and thanks to this creativity, I found myself drawn to business.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI have learned to use my gifts effectively, in order to make sure that I am doing everything that I can to proactively achieve my goals in life.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ELove is forgiveness.\\u003C/strong\\u003E My parents spent their lives building their ministries, and they have made a difference in a lot of lives while making a lot of sacrifices. There is nothing more painful than feeling as if you could have destroyed your parents' ministries and yet, they found a way to not only forgive me, but to help me walk with my head up, despite what I did.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMy family helped me to understand that God can create a miracle and that my girl was my miracle. My way of turning something potentially negative into something positive. A child is a blessing, and despite what many thought I lost, I feel as if I gained the world, and my world continues to shine bright. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T15:10:43-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nancy-laws/lessons-learned-from-being-the-fallen-daughter-of-a-pastor_b_7512442.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nancy-laws/lessons-learned-from-being-the-fallen-daughter-of-a-pastor_b_7512442.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 22:10:43 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Lessons Learned From Being The 'Fallen' Daughter of a Pastor"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 22:24:27 UTC +00:00]]

I must have these. \\u003C/em\\u003EThey're ridiculously priced, but you buy them anyway because well, you just have to.

I, personally, had it \\u003Cem\\u003Eall\\u003C/em\\u003E figured out. So, here they are: my top five hardest falls from that high horse.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E1. Pregnancy diet.\\u003C/strong\\u003E I couldn't wait to be pregnant and show everyone how it should be done -- strictly organic, ample servings of fruits and vegetables, refined sugar only on occasion and in small amounts. I didn't understand how someone could know they were growing a baby and still choose to eat anything but the healthiest foods. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAt about six weeks pregnant, I woke up at 3 a.m. with a violent craving for cheeseburgers, French fries, milkshakes, sour candy and soda. I turned into an animal. Before I knew it, I was in the car and on my way to gather my feast. \\\"My body wouldn't be craving this stuff if it didn't need it,\\\" I successfully convinced myself.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E2. Natural childbirth. \\u003C/strong\\u003EI read every single birth story I could get my hands on. Watching videos of medicated births and voluntary C-sections made my blood boil. \\\"Our bodies are \\u003Cem\\u003Emade\\u003C/em\\u003E for this!\\\" I would proclaim to anyone who would listen. \\\"I just can't understand how people choose to pump their systems full of drugs at this sacred time. What a shame.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAfter 36 hours of unmedicated labor, I was on the floor screaming. I invested the little scraps of energy I had left in figuring out how far of a walk it was to downtown, where I could rob a drug dealer for his stash. 45 minutes and an ambulance ride later, I nearly cried from the relief I felt when that magic fluid entered my spine. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E3. Breastfeeding. \\u003C/strong\\u003E\\\"I've never been more confident,\\\" I would reply when asked if I was nervous about breastfeeding. I could not fathom how anyone would choose to not share this amazing experience with their child if they had the option. I spent an absurd amount of time educating myself on the topic and became a self-proclaimed expert. I learned techniques and positions, researched potential complications and solutions and watched countless videos of mothers nurturing their babies at the breast. I was so in love with the whole thing and couldn't wait for the experience.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nShe latched as soon as they put her on my chest. For the first two days, my baby and I were golden. Then, the pain started. For \\u003Cem\\u003E10 weeks\\u003C/em\\u003E, I cracked, blistered and bled. I went to multiple lactation consultants who told me her latch was fine, I just had extremely delicate skin. She absolutely detested the bottle. When she cried to let me know she was hungry, I would cry. I paced the room in the middle of the night, contemplating giving up. She cluster-fed for the first two months straight, rarely going more than 30 minutes without nursing during the day. I was a milk-cow. A milk cow in pain. Once my body adjusted, the reward was immense, but I now \\u003Cem\\u003Ecompletely understand\\u003C/em\\u003E utilizing pumping and formula-feeding. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E4. Co-sleeping and sleep training.\\u003C/strong\\u003E When planning out my granola-parenting journey, co-sleeping seemed like a no-brainer. I couldn't even imagine sleep training my baby. Co-sleeping would regulate her physiology as a newborn, she wouldn't cry as much, wouldn't wake as often and it would lessen the chore of nursing her at night. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFrom birth, she seemed to require little or no sleep. When she did, she needed to nurse almost non-stop. Shifting positions was a game of Russian Roulette. My back ached from sleeping in the awkward positions I'd freeze in when she stirred. From 4 to 10 months old, she would wake up every 45 minutes at night. I was the living dead. At 10 months, I decided to sleep-train her and I haven't looked back. After only two nights of gritting my teeth while she \\\"adjusted,\\\" she slept five hours straight. I have no regrets. Sleep-training ended up saving my sanity. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E5. Television.\\u003C/strong\\u003E I was adamant that my daughter would not face a television screen until 2 years old, as per the AAP recommendation. When we visited family, I would ask them to turn the TV off, then marinate in the awkward energy I brought to the gathering. My child's elevated IQ would make it worth the inconvenience. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAt 13 months, my daughter would alternate between parkour-like activities that left me with countless messes to clean and convincing me that she would cease to exist if I didn't hold her \\u003Cem\\u003Eright-just-then\\u003C/em\\u003E. I was at the end of my rope one day when I gave her a snack in her high-chair and rolled that thing right up to an episode of \\\"Sesame Street.\\\" I felt like a miracle had occurred when I looked around at my clean house a half hour later. Needless to say, I have used that life raft many times since then. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI am pretty sure that parenting is the most humbling experience I will ever have. I'm glad that my first year has taught me so much, and now I can continue my parenting adventure with some real wisdom. We all come from different backgrounds, and each of our children is unique. I have learned I am in no position to judge the decisions other parents makes for themselves and their children. As cliché as it sounds, we are all just trying to do what we feel in our heart is best for them.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-04-1433436947-3436909-044.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-06-04-1433436947-3436909-044.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-04-1433436947-3436909-044-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"380\\\" height=\\\"570\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/center\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T15:22:38-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-gamboa/my-top-5-soapbox-fails-as-a-new-parent_b_7512276.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-gamboa/my-top-5-soapbox-fails-as-a-new-parent_b_7512276.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 22:22:38 UTC +00:00], ["title", "My Top 5 Soapbox Fails as a New Parent"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 22:52:24 UTC +00:00]]

This took me back a bit, because while Caleb's is a sad situation, he is one of the funniest people I know. His therapist tells me humor is a sign of deep intelligence, and that Caleb couldn't be so funny if there wasn't a lot going on in his head. Let me share a few of my favorite Caleb stories.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\tWhen Caleb was 5 years old, he was in a self-contained class with only three other boys. One of them, Emmanuel, was constantly testing limits and being sent to time-out. Caleb has a heart that hurts when his friends hurt -- he was upset for his friend being in time-out and for his teacher being upset because he adored her. So on a December Sunday, when our pastor flung out her arms and proclaimed, \\\"Rejoice! Emmanuel is coming!\\\" Caleb grabbed the arm of my shirt, his face went almost white and he said in a normal voice, not a quiet church voice, \\\"No Emmanuel coming! No!\\\" Caleb was well-loved in that church, so chuckles abounded.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\t\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThat spring, we were taking a walk in our suburban subdivision, along a path we often walked. There were no farms anywhere near us. Out of one of the bushes popped a rooster. Sophie screamed, I jumped back and Caleb calmly said, \\\"Oh, hi chicken.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\tAround this time, we introduced Caleb to miniature golf. Sophie went, I went, then I stood behind Caleb to teach him how to hold his club. He looked at me, looked at the hole, picked up his ball, walked over and dropped it right in. He looked back at me again, like, \\\"Why do you make things so hard?\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\tCaleb loves movies, television shows and music. He memorizes lines and even though it may seem to be above his functioning level, he knows exactly when to use each phrase. When he was in sixth grade, we had friends over for pizza one night. One of them chose a particularly large slice and said, \\\"That's so big!\\\" Caleb smiled from across the table and said, clear as day, \\\"That's what she said.\\\" Everyone laughed so hard that he put this phrase into regular rotation. He also picked up \\\"Oh, you gotta be kidding me\\\" from somewhere and that one pops up pretty often too.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\tWe had a pool in the backyard of that house. One day, Caleb was floating around when he noticed the brown house next door was being painted green. His eyes lit up and he said, \\\"Mom, make it red!\\\" pointing to our house. It reminded me of the scene in \\u003Cem\\u003ESleeping Beauty \\u003C/em\\u003Ewhere the fairies are fighting over a pink or blue dress for Aurora. I would have loved to wave a wand for him and make the whole house red.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\tAround this time, Caleb broke his femur. He was in a series of body casts for three months and was taking pain medication for a while. Pain meds are notorious for constipation issues, so when his stomach was so swollen it was pushing against the cast, I had to give him an enema. I explained what I was doing, but can anyone really be prepared for those things? As soon as I finished, he looked up at me and said, with perfect diction: \\\"What is wrong with you?\\\" A few minutes passed, the enema did its job and Caleb looked at me and said. \\\"Oh. All better. Thank you.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\tCaleb was blessed by a Make-A-Wish trip last year and he chose his favorite place, Disney World. We were walking through Frontierland when Peter Pan came skipping by. Caleb thinks of Peter Pan as a dear friend so when he passed, Caleb just yelled out, \\\"Hey, Peter Pan!\\\" The young man portraying him that day saw the Make a Wish badge in a flash of a second. He stopped hopping and told Caleb where to go wait and he would come see him in a few minutes. Caleb was like, \\\"Yeah, you will. We're buds.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\tMy aunt convinced Caleb that he would like the ride Star Tours, which we had never ridden. She said that since all boys like Star Wars, Caleb would love this virtual reality ride. We sat down, buckled ourselves in and in the first millisecond of movement and sound I knew we had made a terrible mistake. Caleb looked at me, eyes afire and clapped his hands in front of my face. I kept telling him I was sorry and that if he closed his eyes it wouldn't be so bad, but he kept clapping away. I knew he wasn't in danger of any steep drops and that once the ride was over, he would be fine. His anger was actually a good sign -- he focused so much on that that it took his attention off of his fear. As a special needs parent my choice is often either to cry or laugh my ass off and I chose laughter that day. He was totally fine when we got off the ride and to this day, when I mess up or burn his toast or whatever, he says, \\\"Just like Star Tours!\\\" He hasn't let my aunt live it down either. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\tSophie has been dating her boyfriend Al for almost four years. We all adore him. The first time he came to the house to meet Caleb, Sophie primed him with all she could to prepare him for anything Caleb might say or do.  Sophie and Al sat in the family room and called for Caleb to come say hi. He did, wearing only a t-shirt. At 14 years old. To this day, Sophie and Al call Caleb Winnie the Pooh, due to the similarity in their wardrobe.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\tOne of Caleb's favorite movies is \\u003Cem\\u003EMonsters University\\u003C/em\\u003E. Since Caleb is a giant himself, he identifies with Sully. There's a scene where all the monsters are at a fraternity party, with loud music, strobe lights and lots of dancing. Sully is standing off to the side when Squishy throws an imaginary rope to get Sully to dance. Sully laughs it off, then sort of side-shuffle-dances his way into the crowd. Caleb does the best imitation of this you could imagine. He also does a mean Captain Jack Sparrow.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\tThe incident that led me to write this blog happened just the other night. I had made chicken and baked potatoes for dinner. I haven't baked potatoes in a long time, so I dressed Caleb's with sour cream and cheddar cheese, set it before him and then went to get my plate. By the time I sat down, Caleb had picked up his potato, folded it closed and was eating it like a sandwich, skin and all. I started to giggle and said, \\\"Here, honey, eat it like this,\\\" modeling the use of a fork. Caleb shook his head and said, \\\"No. Like this,\\\" and kept chomping away.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\tI always say that Caleb has had to conform in so many ways to live in our world. I think conforming some of my ways to his is a better idea, because his world is a much more fun place to be. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T15:20:58-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-welch/sully-captain-jack-and-the-baked-potato-an-insiders-guide-to-calebs-sense-of-humor_b_7511808.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-welch/sully-captain-jack-and-the-baked-potato-an-insiders-guide-to-calebs-sense-of-humor_b_7511808.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 22:20:58 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Sully, Captain Jack and the Baked Potato: An Insider's Guide to Caleb's Sense of Humor"], ["updated_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 22:52:24 UTC +00:00]]

The San Francisco Bay Area city then pays them a monthly stipend, ranging from $300 to $1,000, over the course of 18 months in exchange for sticking with an individualized “life map” of positive behavior -- such as GED programs, anger management therapy and job training. The better they do, the more they are paid.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nParticipants are also connected with community mentors, who are credible in part because many have their own violent pasts. The mentors keep in close contact with the young men throughout the program. But importantly, as Mother Jones noted in a 2014 story, the mentors \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/06/richmond-california-murder-rate-gun-death\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Edo not share information about participants\\u003C/a\\u003E with law enforcement. Though the program has the police department's blessing, it operates independently.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhile partially funded by the city of 100,000-plus residents, the program is also not wholly dependent on the taxpayers. Private donors have stepped in to help pay for those financial incentives.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe results of Richmond's initiative, which started almost eight years ago, have been encouraging. The Washington Post reports that of the 68 participants since 2010, 54 have not been charged with another gun-related crime -- and only four have died. Some of the participants have gone on to attend a four-year college. Additionally, the city’s murder rate has declined 77 percent in recent years, from 47 deaths in 2007 to \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.contracostatimes.com/west-county-times/ci_27240649/richmond-crime-down-2014-homicides-reach-yet-another\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E11 deaths last year\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n“It’s amazing,” DeVone Boggan, the program’s creator and director, told the Post, “and it has to do with focusing on those driving violence and recognizing that they have a great deal of power in terms of gun violence in our city and whether it goes up or down.”\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOther factors, of course, are at play in Richmond. As Al Jazeera noted, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/america-tonight/articles/2014/6/6/a-city-that-payscriminalstobehave.html\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Eunemployment has declined\\u003C/a\\u003E and gentrification increased in cities across California, contributing to reductions in violent crime.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAdditionally, the Richmond police force has been credited with \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.yesmagazine.org/peace-justice/police-violence-is-not-inevitable-four-ways-a-california-police-chief-connected-cops-with-communities\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Eembracing community policing and reducing its use of deadly force\\u003C/a\\u003E since Chris Magnus became chief in 2006, as Yes!

From a Single Mom\",\"link\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sharon-zarozny/wedding-day-wisdom-from-a-single-mom_b_7506260.html\",\"author\":\"Sharon Zarozny\",\"description\":\"Last fall, my daughter and her fiancé asked me to officiate at their wedding happening this weekend. I was speechless. My first thought was, \\\"Marriage is serious business--- will they take their vows seriously if I'm the one presiding?\\\" Followed by, \\\"How will my Catholic family handle this one?\\\" \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThen I flashed back to all the turmoil I went through when my two daughters were little, worrying that if I divorced I'd ruin their lives forever, especially their chances at a happy marriage. Fortunately, my next thought was, \\\"I guess things turned out better than OK, because this is quite an honor ... and I doubt it would have happened had I not raised her as a single mom.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIt also reaffirmed to me that a divorce is not the end of the world. Yes, our family life has not been as I'd imagined it, and my daughters and I have struggled. But we've also learned to adapt (sometimes begrudgingly) and to realize change can stretch us in good ways we never imagined. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI grew up innocently believing (thank you, happily-ever-after fairytale endings) that once I became an adult my life would settle into a nice routine and go on as calmly as it appeared to be doing for most of the adults around me. My daughters, however, grew up knowing that  life delivers unexpected bumps that can turn one's world upside down. Hopefully, they've also learned bumps can catapult us into new ways and gifts.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhen my oldest started dating in high school, I remember her lamenting,\\\"It's not fair that I've had no role model of how to be in a relationship because you and dad broke up when I was little. All my friends have parents who stayed together and so they know how to be in a relationship. It's so unfair.\\\" \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSomehow, I managed the comeback, \\\"Actually, you're lucky. You get to create your own way to be a couple and you aren't stuck unknowingly repeating what we did.\\\" Stunned, she went off to her room -- a real coup for any mom of a teenager.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBack to the wedding, which is now only days away. Taking my minister role seriously, I've been immersed in all kinds of readings about love and marriage. And of course, Pinterest's Wedding Boards full of DIY projects that have taken over our lives.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI've discovered that centuries ago, June became the most popular month for weddings -- thanks to the \\\"annual bath\\\", a once-a-year communal event (really, people back then only bathed once a year) happened, leading couples to marry soon afterwards because they looked, and smelled, their best. Flowers came to be a big deal-- to mask body odor. And bridesmaids? Dressed identically to the bride, they were actually decoys to confuse greedy folks wanting to kidnap a wealthy bride for her dowry. The best man, and bridesmaids, also had the job of getting the bride to the church on time and fending off unsavory and hostile family members.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHowever, what's amazed me most as I scour the web is how, despite the fact many marriages end in divorce, the fairytale aspect is still alive and well. It's now popular for brides and grooms to pose holding rustic signs reading \\\"Happily-Ever-After\\\" and \\\"Mr. \\u0026 Mrs.\\\" -- not \\\"Ms.\\\" as in my day. Women plan their weddings on Pinterest, before they are even engaged.  A friend's daughter recently told me she was worried about her brother's choice of fiancé saying, \\\"Shouldn't it have been a red flag, to him, that his girlfriend had a Wedding Board ...\\u003Cem\\u003E before \\u003C/em\\u003Ethey even met?\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI'm still searching for pearls of wisdom to share with my daughter and soon-to-be son-in-law on their wedding day. Knowing the pain of losing the dream, I want to protect them both from a similar fate, while I honor their joy. Its a tricky line to walk, because I want them to realize what they are getting into, but I don't want to burst their romantic bubble.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSo far, the best I can do is tell them love is a choice you make every day and it's the annoying little things, which build up over time, that chip away at your love and marital bond.  (See \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sharon-zarozny/falling-out-of-love_b_5942568.html\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E\\\"Falling Out of Love\\\"\\u003C/a\\u003E) If you can keep the lines of communication open (listen, listen, listen) you give each other a shot at building a loving relationship. Otherwise, you could fail each other without even understanding why -- and that's one of the big, painful questions I see the men and women I work with struggle through, when it's too late. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnd, I want to thank them both for trusting me, a divorced single mom, to conduct their ceremony and rite of passage into married life. It's an honor that's softened the blow of my own difficult divorce and it lets me know things have turned out OK. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIf you have wisdom to share, please send it along to me. And I'll pass it on to others... \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-06-04T15:18:08-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sharon-zarozny/wedding-day-wisdom-from-a-single-mom_b_7506260.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sharon-zarozny/wedding-day-wisdom-from-a-single-mom_b_7506260.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 04 Jun 2015 22:18:08 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Wedding Day Wisdom...
